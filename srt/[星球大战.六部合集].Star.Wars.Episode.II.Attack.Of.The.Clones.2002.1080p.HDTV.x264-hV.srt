1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,830
远古以前，一个遥远的星系…
{\fs14}--

2
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:35,501
星球大战
{\fs14}--

3
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:45,840
前传 II 克隆人的进攻
{\fs14}--

4
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:51,252
银河参议会掀起一场骚动
{\fs14}--

5
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:54,319
数千个星系纷纷表达…
{\fs14}--

6
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:57,391
退出共和国的意图
{\fs14}--

7
00:00:58,104 --> 00:01:01,062
分离主义运动…
{\fs14}--

8
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:04,132
在神秘的杜酷伯爵带领下…
{\fs14}--

9
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:07,202
逐渐脱离绝地武士的掌握
{\fs14}--

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,269
银河的和平秩序面临失控
{\fs14}--

11
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:15,740
艾米达拉参议员，前那卜女王
{\fs14}--

12
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:18,812
正赶往银河参议会
{\fs14}--

13
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:21,883
为重大议案投下一票
{\fs14}--

14
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,953
决定是否建立共和军
{\fs14}--

15
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:28,022
协助寡不敌众的绝地武士
{\fs14}--

16
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:12,808
参议员，我们即将抵达科罗森
{\fs14}Senator, we're making our final approach into Coruscant.

1
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,109
--
{\fs14}Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,667
成功安全抵达
{\fs14}We made it.

4
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:10,871
看来是我错了
{\fs14}I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,171
似乎根本没有危险
{\fs14}There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:32,658
柯笛…
{\fs14}Cordé.

7
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,969
殿下…很抱歉
{\fs14}Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,964
我未能完成使命，参议员
{\fs14}I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,199
不
{\fs14}No.

10
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,868
殿下，此处尚有危险
{\fs14}Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:55,618
我根本不该回来  -这次投票很重要
{\fs14}- I shouldn't have come back.- This vote is very important.

12
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:59,552
你尽忠职守。柯笛鞠躬尽瘁了，走吧。
{\fs14}You did your duty.Cordé did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:03,522
艾米达拉议员，请
{\fs14}Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:17,903
我没把握投票还能拖延多久
{\fs14}I don't know how much longer,I can hold off the vote,my friends.

15
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:21,846
越来越多星系投入分离主义
{\fs14}More and more star systems are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:22,780
一旦他们脱离…
{\fs14}If they do break away...

17
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:27,149
我不会坐视共和国…，屹立千年之后
{\fs14}I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years...

18
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,313
竟一分为二
{\fs14}be split in two.

19
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:31,392
我的协商不会破裂
{\fs14}My negotiations will not fail.

20
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:34,058
万一协商不成，你了解…
{\fs14}If they do, you must realize...

21
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:36,255
绝地武士不足以保护共和国
{\fs14}there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic.

22
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,895
我们是和平保护者，不是军人
{\fs14}We're keepers of the peace,not soldiers.

23
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,064
尤达大师…
{\fs14}Master Yoda...

24
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,701
你认为真的会有战争吗？
{\fs14}do you think it will really come to war?

25
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,510
黑暗势力无孔不入
{\fs14}The dark side clouds everything.

26
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:57,574
无法看清未来之事
{\fs14}Impossible to see the future is.

27
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:01,652
皇家委员已抵达，阁下
{\fs14}The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honor.

28
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:02,746
很好
{\fs14}Good.

29
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:06,455
请他们进来
{\fs14}Send them in.

30
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:09,396
此事稍后再讨论
{\fs14}We will discuss this matter later.

31
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:17,472
艾米达拉参议员…，登陆台上的悲剧让人
{\fs14}Senator Amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform...

32
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:19,474
遗憾
{\fs14}terrible.

33
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,372
你的平安让我十分宽心
{\fs14}Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.

34
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,210
你们知不知道是谁指使的？
{\fs14}Do you have any idea who was behind this attack?

35
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:29,912
我们的情报显示是，那卜星不满的香料矿工所为
{\fs14}Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

36
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:32,881
我认为是杜酷伯爵策动的
{\fs14}I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

37
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:36,893
他是政治理想家，不是杀人魔
{\fs14}He is a political idealist,not a murderer.

38
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:39,987
殿下，杜酷伯爵曾是绝地武士
{\fs14}You know, milady,Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

39
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:43,556
他不可能从事暗杀，他的人格不允许他这么做。
{\fs14}He couldn't assassinate anyone.It's not in his character.

40
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:46,228
确定的是，参议员…
{\fs14}But for certain, Senator...

41
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:50,171
你的处境极为危险
{\fs14}in grave danger you are.

42
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,243
绝地大师，容我建议安排…
{\fs14}Master Jedi, may I suggest...

43
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:57,441
参议员接受你们的保护
{\fs14}the senator be placed under the protection of your graces?

44
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,610
明智吗？时局如此紧张之际
{\fs14}Do you really think that's a wise decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,846
议长阁下，我不相信…
{\fs14}Chancellor, if I may comment,I do not believe...

46
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,287
…时局…真有如此严重
{\fs14}The situation is that serious?

47
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,849
不，但我认为，参议员…
{\fs14}No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,293
我了解额外的保全…
{\fs14}I realize all too well that additional security...

49
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:13,889
会对你造成困扰，
{\fs14}might be disruptive for you...

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,662
但…或许我能指派个熟人…
{\fs14}but perhaps someone you're familiar with.

51
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:20,803
老朋友，比如说肯诺比大师
{\fs14}An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:23,199
颇为可行
{\fs14}That's possible.

53
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,040
他刚调解完昂逊星的疆界纠纷
{\fs14}He's just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,341
请给我个面子，殿下
{\fs14}Do it for me, milady. Please?

55
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,849
万一失去你
{\fs14}The thought of losing you...

56
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:34,646
我将无法忍受
{\fs14}is unbearable.

57
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:38,720
我请欧比王立刻向你报到
{\fs14}I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,056
谢谢你，云杜大师
{\fs14}Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:53,970
- 你好像很紧张  - 一点也不
{\fs14}- You seem a little on edge.- Not at all.

60
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:57,704
从误陷钢鞑巢穴后…，没看过你这么紧张。
{\fs14}I haven't felt you this tense since we fell into that nest of gundarks.

61
00:06:58,446 --> 00:07:00,437
是你深陷险境，师父
{\fs14}You fell into that nightmare, Master...

62
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:02,982
我救了你，记得吗？
{\fs14}and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:05,476
对啦
{\fs14}Oh... yes.

64
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:13,986
你在冒汗，放轻松，深呼吸
{\fs14}You're sweating. Relax.Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,191
跟她已经十年不见了
{\fs14}I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,610
欧比？欧比！
{\fs14}Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:37,379
- 好高兴见到你！ - 很高兴又见面，喳喳
{\fs14}- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!- Good to see you again, JarJar.

68
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:39,478
帕米参议员！
{\fs14}Senator Padmé.

69
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:43,184
我朋友来了，你看，参议员
{\fs14}Mesa palos here!Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:46,023
绝地武士到了
{\fs14}Desa Jedi arriven.

71
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,595
很荣幸再见面，殿下
{\fs14}It's a great pleasure to see you again, milady.

72
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:54,193
时光飞逝啊，肯诺比大师
{\fs14}It has been far too long,Master Kenobi.

73
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,005
安纳？
{\fs14}Ani?

74
00:07:57,107 --> 00:08:00,406
- 天啊，你长大了 - 你也是啊
{\fs14}- My goodness, you've grown. - So have you.

75
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,911
我是说，你更漂亮了
{\fs14}Grown more beautiful, I mean.

76
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,709
以参议员的标准来说
{\fs14}Well, for a senator, I mean.

77
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:10,213
对我你永远是塔图印的小男孩
{\fs14}Ani, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.

78
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,248
我承诺你不会感到我们的存在
{\fs14}Our presence here will be invisible,milady, I can assure you.

79
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,828
泰佛队长，陛下的护卫
{\fs14}I'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty's security service.

80
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:19,988
亚蜜莉雅女王已得知这项指派
{\fs14}Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment.

81
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:22,225
很高兴你能来
{\fs14}I am grateful you are here,Master Kenobi.

82
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,098
局势比参议员所知的更险恶
{\fs14}The situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit.

83
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,899
我需要答案，不是加强警戒
{\fs14}I don't need more security.I need answers.

84
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:30,236
我要知道谁想杀我
{\fs14}I want to know who's trying to kill me.

85
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:33,176
我们是来保护你，不是来调查
{\fs14}We are here to protect you,Senator, not to start an investigation.

86
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,679
我们会查出谁想杀你，帕米…
{\fs14}We will find out who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

87
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,612
--
{\fs14}I promise you.

88
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,447
我们不会逾越职权，小徒弟
{\fs14}We will not exceed our mandate,my young Padawan learner.

89
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,522
我只是说尽力保护她，师父
{\fs14}I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.

90
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,124
别再跟我争辩，安纳金
{\fs14}We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin...

91
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,193
多听从我的教诲
{\fs14}and you will pay attention to my lead.

92
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,353
- 为什么？ - 什么？
{\fs14}- Why? - What?

93
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,962
派我们来为什么不调查凶手？
{\fs14}Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer?

94
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,367
保护工作是本地警方的任务，派绝地武士等于杀鸡用牛刀
{\fs14}Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi.

95
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:01,305
所以调查权隐含在我们职权内
{\fs14}It's overkill, Master.Investigation is implied in our mandate.

96
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,673
我们遵守议长的指示就是了
{\fs14}We will do exactly as the council has instructed.

97
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,172
学着恪遵本分，年轻人
{\fs14}And you will learn your place, young one.

98
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,712
你们的出现
{\fs14}Perhaps with merely your presence...

99
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,757
就显得事有蹊跷了
{\fs14}the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed.

100
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,453
若不介意…
{\fs14}Now, if you'll excuse me...

101
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:22,390
容我告退
{\fs14}I will retire.

102
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:25,824
你们留在这里让我放心多了
{\fs14}I know I'll feel better having you here.

103
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,094
我会在每层楼都派驻军官
{\fs14}I'll have an officer stationed on every floor...

104
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:30,363
我本人在楼下指挥中心
{\fs14}and I'll be in the control center downstairs.

105
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:34,998
真高兴又见面了，安纳
{\fs14}Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani.

106
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:38,237
她几乎不认识我了，喳喳
{\fs14}She hardly even recognized me, JarJar.

107
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,816
她走后我天天思念她
{\fs14}I've thought about her every day since we parted and...

108
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:45,153
她却把我忘得一干二净
{\fs14}she's forgotten me completely.

109
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:46,915
她很快乐
{\fs14}She sa happy.

110
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,422
比以前还快乐
{\fs14}Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.

111
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:53,325
你尽往坏处想，当心你的思想
{\fs14}You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:56,097
刚见面时她十分开心
{\fs14}She was pleased to see us.

113
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:58,166
去检查一下安全措施
{\fs14}Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:08,270
击中了太空船，但他们用替身
{\fs14}I hit the ship,but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:10,642
要用更巧妙的手段，婵姆
{\fs14}We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:12,772
我的客户快失去耐性了
{\fs14}My client is getting impatient.

117
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:15,715
拿去，小心有毒
{\fs14}Take these. Be careful.They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:19,255
婵姆，这次不能再出错了
{\fs14}And, Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:25,026
泰佛队长派很多人驻扎楼下
{\fs14}Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs.

120
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:27,062
刺客不会从那里进来
{\fs14}No assassin would try that way.

121
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,190
- 上面有动静吗？ - 一片死寂
{\fs14}- Any activity up here? - Quiet as a tomb.

122
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:34,567
我不喜欢苦等
{\fs14}I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.

123
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,203
- 怎么回事？ - 摄影机遮住了
{\fs14}- What's going on? - She covered the cameras.

124
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:39,967
她不想让我看
{\fs14}I don't think she liked me watching her.

125
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:41,977
她心里在想什么？
{\fs14}What is she thinking?

126
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,071
有入侵者R2会警告我们
{\fs14}She programmed R2 to warn us if there is an intruder.

127
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:47,810
刺杀参议员的方法不仅只如此
{\fs14}There are many other ways to kill a senator.

128
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:52,252
我知道，我们也想抓刺客吧？
{\fs14}I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don't we, Master?

129
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:55,485
你把她当成饵？
{\fs14}You're using her as bait.

130
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:57,653
那是她的主意
{\fs14}It was her idea.

131
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,322
别担心，她不会受到任何伤害
{\fs14}Don't worry.No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,401
我可以感觉她房内的一举一动
{\fs14}I can sense everything going on in that room.

133
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:05,766
相信我
{\fs14}Trust me.

134
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:07,771
风险太高
{\fs14}It's too risky.

135
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:11,470
再说，你的感觉还不够协调
{\fs14}Besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice.

136
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:13,902
你的就够协调？
{\fs14}And yours are?

137
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:17,979
可以这么说
{\fs14}Possibly.

138
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,298
你很累了
{\fs14}You look tired.

139
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,024
我再也睡不安稳
{\fs14}I don't sleep well anymore.

140
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:37,626
因为你的母亲？
{\fs14}Because of your mother?

141
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,607
不晓得为什么一直梦见她
{\fs14}I don't know why I keep dreaming about her.

142
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:50,282
梦境随时间消逝
{\fs14}Dreams pass in time.

143
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:54,412
我宁可梦见帕米
{\fs14}I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

144
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:58,719
待在她身边就令人脸红心跳
{\fs14}Just being around her again is...intoxicating.

145
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:01,293
当心你的思绪，它会背叛你
{\fs14}Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.They betray you.

146
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:03,727
你承诺过要信守绝地武士诫律
{\fs14}You've made a commitment to the Jedi order...

147
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,889
你承诺过要信守绝地武士诫律
{\fs14}a commitment not easily broken.

148
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,763
她是政治人物，不值得信赖
{\fs14}And don't forget, she's a politician.They're not to be trusted.

149
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,463
她跟其他议员不一样
{\fs14}She's not like the others in the senate, Master.

150
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:12,699
根据我的经验，议员们…
{\fs14}It is my experience that senators focus...

151
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,707
只讨好赞助自己政治主张的人
{\fs14}only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns...

152
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,005
往往不顾民主真义
{\fs14}and they're in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy...

153
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,309
- 为获得赞助 - 不要再说教了
{\fs14}- in order to get those funds.- Not another lecture.

154
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:25,215
至少不要谈政客的黑金问题
{\fs14}At least not on the economics of politics.

155
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:20,572
而且你是以偏概全
{\fs14}And besides, you're generalizing.

156
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,737
议长不像个贪官感吏
{\fs14}The chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.

157
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,508
白卜庭是个政客
{\fs14}Palpatine is a politician.

158
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:27,243
他是个聪明人
{\fs14}I have observed that he is very clever...

159
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:31,344
深谙投各议员所好的巧妙手腕
{\fs14}in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators.

160
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,320
我认为他是个好人，师…
{\fs14}I think he's a good man...

161
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:35,324
我也感觉到了
{\fs14}I sense it too.

162
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,504
留在这里！
{\fs14}Stay here!

163
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:57,847
您没事吧？
{\fs14}Are you all right, milady?

164
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:33,511
搞什么？
{\fs14}What the...

165
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,821
--
{\fs14}Jedi poo doo!

166
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:42,955
怎么这么慢？
{\fs14}- What took you so long?- Oh, you know, Master.

167
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,960
- 找不到中意的飞艇… - 他在那里
{\fs14}- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...- There he is.

168
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:49,463
…要敞蓬座舱，速度又要快
{\fs14}With the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities.

169
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:52,364
你要是多练光剑少练嘴皮子
{\fs14}If you spent as long practicing your saber techniques as you do your wit...

170
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:54,198
剑术大概可以直逼尤达大师了
{\fs14}you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.

171
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:55,999
我已经跟他不相上下了
{\fs14}I thought I already did.

172
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,802
别一厢情愿，小徒弟
{\fs14}Only in your mind,my very young apprentice.

173
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:28,738
拉起来，安纳金，拉起来！
{\fs14}Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

174
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,974
我不喜欢你乱耍花招
{\fs14}You know I don't like it when you do that.

175
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,346
抱歉师父，忘了你不喜欢飞行
{\fs14}Sorry, Master.I forgot you don't like flying.

176
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:43,250
飞行还好，你刚刚是自杀！
{\fs14}I don't mind flying,but what you're doing is suicide!

177
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,519
跟你说过多少次…
{\fs14}Anakin! How many times have I told you...

178
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:15,848
不要穿越电藕火花
{\fs14}stay away from power couplings!

179
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:18,855
得到教训了吧
{\fs14}That was good!

180
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:35,933
你要去哪？他往那边去了！
{\fs14}Where are you going?He went that way.

181
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:38,069
继续追下去，
{\fs14}Master, if we keep this chase going any longer...

182
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,170
那怪胎会被烧焦
{\fs14}that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

183
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:44,582
我想查出他是谁？谁派来的？
{\fs14}and, personally, I'd like to find out who he is and who he's working for.

184
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:47,348
这是捷径…我认为
{\fs14}This is a shortcut... I think.

185
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,015
好啦，跟丢了
{\fs14}Well, you've lost him.

186
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,611
非常抱歉，师父
{\fs14}I'm deeply sorry, Master.

187
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,621
好个捷径，
{\fs14}That was some shortcut, Anakin.

188
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,157
他根本往另一边走
{\fs14}He went completely the other way.

189
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:24,284
- 再一次证明你… - 失陪一下
{\fs14}- Once again you've proved...- If you'll excuse me.

190
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,424
可恶，他又来这套
{\fs14}I hate it when he does that.

191
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:53,211
安纳金！
{\fs14}Anakin!

192
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:57,150
- 她逃进俱乐部里了，师父 - 耐心
{\fs14}- She went into the club, Master.- Patience.

193
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:59,780
- 使用原力，思考 - 对不起，师父
{\fs14}- Use the Force. Think.- Sorry, Master.

194
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,654
- 他是躲进去，不是从那逃走 - 是的，师父
{\fs14}- He went in there to hide, not to run.- Yes, Master.

195
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,557
- 下次不要乱丢 - 是的，师父
{\fs14}- Next time, try not to lose it.- Yes, Master.

196
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:09,598
- 这武器是你的生命 - 我尽量记住，师父
{\fs14}- This weapon is your life.- I try, Master.

197
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:12,395
老感觉总有一天我会被你害死
{\fs14}Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?

198
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,198
别这么说，
{\fs14}Don't say that, Master.

199
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:16,363
我把你当成父亲
{\fs14}You're the closest thing I have to a father.

200
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:18,338
那你怎么老是不听话？
{\fs14}Then why don't you listen to me?

201
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,034
我正在努力
{\fs14}I am trying.

202
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,090
看到他了吗？
{\fs14}Can you see him?

203
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,159
我认为他是个女的
{\fs14}I think he is a she...

204
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,922
而且她会变身
{\fs14}and I think she is a changeling.

205
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,158
这么说，要格外小心
{\fs14}In that case, be extra careful.

206
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,669
- 去找她 - 你要去哪里？
{\fs14}- Go and find her.- Where are you going, Master?

207
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,237
喝一杯
{\fs14}For a drink.

208
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,646
谢谢
{\fs14}Thank you.

209
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,843
- 要不要买点销魂棒？ - 不要向我兜售销魂棒
{\fs14}- You wanna buy some death sticks?  - You don't want to sell me death sticks.

210
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,889
我不向你兜售销魂棒
{\fs14}I don't want to sell you death sticks.

211
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,083
回家思考生命的意义
{\fs14}You want to go home and rethink your life.

212
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,525
我要回家思考生命的意义
{\fs14}I want to go home and rethink my life.

213
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,007
没事
{\fs14}Easy.

214
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:59,238
绝地武士任务，继续喝
{\fs14}Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.

215
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:07,514
你知道你刺杀的是谁吗？
{\fs14}Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?

216
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,919
那卜星的参议员
{\fs14}It was a senator from Naboo.

217
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:12,721
- 谁雇你的？ - 只不过是出趟任务
{\fs14}- And who hired you? - It was just a job.

218
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:16,092
谁雇你的？说
{\fs14}Who hired you? Tell us.

219
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,590
快说！
{\fs14}Tell us now!

220
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:22,400
一位赏金猎人，叫…
{\fs14}It was a bounty hunter called...

221
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:32,169
--
{\fs14}Wee shahnit... sleemo.

222
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:41,588
毒镖
{\fs14}Toxic dart.

223
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:56,063
查出这个赏金猎人，欧比王
{\fs14}Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan.

224
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:59,631
更重要的是查出谁在主使
{\fs14}Most importantly, find out who he's working for.

225
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:03,645
艾米达拉议员还需要保护吗？
{\fs14}What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting.

226
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:06,648
你徒弟会去执行
{\fs14}Handle that your Padawan will.

227
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:12,048
安纳金，保护参议员回那卜星
{\fs14}Anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo.

228
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:15,887
她在那儿比较安全。别搭乘公共运输
{\fs14}She'll be safer there. And don't use registered transport.

229
00:24:15,993 --> 00:24:16,984
乔装成难民
{\fs14}Travel as refugees.

230
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:19,996
身为反对阵营领袖，她不太容易
{\fs14}As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult...

231
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:22,464
离开首都
{\fs14}to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.

232
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:26,268
逮到杀手前…
{\fs14}Until caught this killer is...

233
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:29,431
她必须遵守我们的裁定
{\fs14}our judgment she must respect.

234
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:32,001
安纳金，到参议院去
{\fs14}Anakin, go to the senate...

235
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,273
要求白卜庭议长找她谈谈
{\fs14}and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.

236
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:45,123
我跟她沟通
{\fs14}I will talk with her.

237
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:48,352
艾米达拉议员不会违抗我的命令
{\fs14}Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order.

238
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:50,622
我跟她很熟，不会有问题
{\fs14}I know her well enough to assure you of that.

239
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,789
谢谢您，阁下
{\fs14}Thank you, Your Excellency.

240
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:56,265
他们终于派任务给你了
{\fs14}And so, they've finally given you an assignment.

241
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:58,361
你的耐心有了代价
{\fs14}Your patience has paid off.

242
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:00,803
你的指导功用更胜于我的耐心
{\fs14}Your guidance more than my patience.

243
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,307
你不需要人指导，安纳金
{\fs14}You don't need guidance, Anakin.

244
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,637
你很快将学会相信自己的感觉
{\fs14}In time, you will learn to trust your feelings.

245
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:12,677
然后你就所向无敌了
{\fs14}Then you will be invincible.

246
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,722
我说过很多次
{\fs14}I have said it many times:

247
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,588
你是最有天赋的绝地武士
{\fs14}You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.

248
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:22,594
多谢褒奖，阁下
{\fs14}Thank you, Your Excellency.

249
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:26,393
你会成为最伟大的绝地武士
{\fs14}I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin...

250
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,025
力量更胜于尤达大师
{\fs14}even more powerful than Master Yoda.

251
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:35,232
我很替我徒弟担心
{\fs14}I am concerned for my Padawan.

252
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:38,039
他还不适合接派任务
{\fs14}He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.

253
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:40,410
议会对其决定有信心
{\fs14}The council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.

254
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:42,484
那男孩有过人的才能
{\fs14}The boy has exceptional skills.

255
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,018
但他还有很多要学
{\fs14}But he still has much to learn, Master.

256
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,556
他的能力使得他…傲慢自大
{\fs14}His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.

257
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,658
对
{\fs14}Yes.

258
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,694
绝地武士日益普遍的缺点
{\fs14}A flaw more and more common among Jedi.

259
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:58,198
太自以为是
{\fs14}Too sure of themselves they are.

260
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,758
甚至老一辈有经验的也一样
{\fs14}Even the older, more experienced ones.

261
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,431
记住，欧比王，若预言成真…
{\fs14}Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true...

262
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:09,170
只有安纳金能让原力重归和谐
{\fs14}your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.

263
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:15,115
我要请一段长假
{\fs14}I'm taking an extended leave of absence.

264
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:18,346
你得在参议院代理我的职务
{\fs14}It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate.

265
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:21,356
冰克斯代表…全靠你啦
{\fs14}Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.

266
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:25,952
很荣幸担此重任
{\fs14}Mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden.

267
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:30,629
我十分谦虚的接受任务
{\fs14}Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and...

268
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:33,293
喳喳，我不耽搁你的时间
{\fs14}JarJar, I don't wish to hold you up.

269
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:35,371
你还有很多工作要做
{\fs14}I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

270
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:36,269
那当然…
{\fs14}Of course.

271
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:38,132
殿下
{\fs14}Milady.

272
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:44,611
我不喜欢躲躲藏藏
{\fs14}I do not like this idea of hiding.

273
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,811
别担心
{\fs14}Don't worry.

274
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:49,112
议会已下令调查
{\fs14}Now that the council has ordered an investigation...

275
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:50,915
欧比王大师会找出那赏金猎人
{\fs14}it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter.

276
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:53,923
我努力一整年对抗建军案
{\fs14}I haven't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act...

277
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:56,084
事到临头竟无法投票
{\fs14}to not be here when its fate is decided.

278
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:58,253
有时得将自尊摆一边
{\fs14}Sometimes we must let go of our pride...

279
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:00,923
听命行事
{\fs14}and do what is requested of us.

280
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:03,466
安纳金…你成熟多了
{\fs14}Anakin, you've grown up.

281
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,771
欧比王却极力视而不见
{\fs14}Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

282
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:16,274
别误会
{\fs14}Don't get me wrong.

283
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:18,213
欧比王是个好老师
{\fs14}Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

284
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:20,842
他智慧可比尤达大师
{\fs14}As wise as Master Yoda and...

285
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:23,080
力量不输云杜大师
{\fs14}as powerful as Master Windu.

286
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,858
我很感激他收我为徒
{\fs14}I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.

287
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:33,089
但在某些方面…许多方面…
{\fs14}In some ways... a lot of ways...

288
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:36,102
我已经青出于蓝
{\fs14}I'm really ahead of him.

289
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:38,702
我已经准备好接受试验
{\fs14}I'm ready for the trials...

290
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:42,206
但他觉得我难以捉摸
{\fs14}but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

291
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:44,209
不让我更上一层楼
{\fs14}He won't let me move on.

292
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:47,376
- 你一定感到很挫折 - 比挫折还糟！
{\fs14}- That must be frustrating. - It's worse.

293
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:50,279
他百般挑剔，从不听我说
{\fs14}He's overly critical. He never listens.

294
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,750
他不了解我
{\fs14}He doesn't understand.

295
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:54,946
这不公平！
{\fs14}It's not fair!

296
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:59,890
师父比我们更容易看清缺点
{\fs14}All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like.

297
00:27:59,993 --> 00:28:01,984
我们就是这样成长的
{\fs14}It's the only way we grow.

298
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:04,530
我了解
{\fs14}I know.

299
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,491
安纳金…
{\fs14}Anakin...

300
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:12,396
不要急着长大
{\fs14}don't try to grow up too fast.

301
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,498
但我已经长大了
{\fs14}But I am grown up.

302
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,579
你自己也这么说过
{\fs14}You said it yourself.

303
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:21,807
不要这样看我
{\fs14}Please don't look at me like that.

304
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,274
为什么？
{\fs14}Why not?

305
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,512
看得我浑身不自在
{\fs14}It makes me feel uncomfortable.

306
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:29,491
对不起，殿下
{\fs14}Sorry, milady.

307
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:47,537
- 保重，殿下 - 谢谢你，队长
{\fs14}- Be safe, milady. - Thank you, Captain.

308
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,703
多照顾朵美，威胁转向你们了
{\fs14}Take good care of Dormé. The threat's on you two now.

309
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,781
他跟我在一起很安全
{\fs14}He'll be safe with me.

310
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:57,846
你不会有事的
{\fs14}You'll be fine.

311
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:01,151
问题不在我，我担心的是你
{\fs14}It's not me, milady. I worry about you.

312
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:03,589
万一他们知道你离开首都呢？
{\fs14}What if they realize you've left the capital?

313
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:08,060
我的保护者就得秀出真本事了
{\fs14}Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.

314
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,064
安纳金
{\fs14}Anakin...

315
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,260
采取任何行动前…，先询问我或议会的意见
{\fs14}don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council.

316
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,303
是的，师父
{\fs14}Yes, Master.

317
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:17,998
我会查清楚这项阴谋
{\fs14}I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady.

318
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:20,043
你很快就可以再回来
{\fs14}You'll be back here in no time.

319
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:23,375
非常感谢你迅速查案
{\fs14}I'll be most grateful for your speed, MasterJedi.

320
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:25,381
- 该走了 - 我知道
{\fs14}- It's time to go. - I know.

321
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:28,008
安纳金，愿原力与你同在
{\fs14}Anakin, may the Force be with you.

322
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,144
愿原力与你同在，师父
{\fs14}May the Force be with you, Master.

323
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:42,497
我突然感到害怕
{\fs14}Suddenly I'm afraid.

324
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:46,230
这是我第一次单独出任务
{\fs14}This is my first assignment on my own. I am too.

325
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,767
我也会害怕。不用担心，有R2在
{\fs14}Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

326
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:57,673
我希望他不会轻举妄动
{\fs14}I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.

327
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:02,909
我反而比较担心她会轻举妄动
{\fs14}I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.

328
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,435
亲爱的，有人来找你
{\fs14}Someone to see ya, honey!

329
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:26,778
看起来是个绝地武士
{\fs14}Jedi, by the looks of him.

330
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:29,440
欧比王！
{\fs14}Obi-Wan!

331
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:31,814
哈罗，德克斯
{\fs14}Hello, Dex.

332
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,513
坐一下，我马上过来
{\fs14}Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

333
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:39,893
- 来一杯夹哇果汁吧 - 好啊，谢谢
{\fs14}- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?- Oh, yes. Thank you.

334
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:46,726
嘿…老哥！
{\fs14}Old buddy!

335
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,079
老朋友，我能帮什么忙？
{\fs14}So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

336
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,010
这是什么东西？
{\fs14}You can tell me what this is.

337
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:04,747
--
{\fs14}Well, whattaya know!

338
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:07,253
很久没见到这玩意，自从…
{\fs14}I ain't seen one of these since I was prospectin'...

339
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:10,585
在外星系外的萨特罗采矿之后
{\fs14}on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

340
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:13,126
它从哪里来的？
{\fs14}Can you tell me where it came from?

341
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:15,197
这是克隆人的东西
{\fs14}This baby belongs to them cloners.

342
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:19,631
这支是卡密诺星的剑镖
{\fs14}What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.

343
00:31:19,735 --> 00:31:22,704
档案资料库里没有这东西
{\fs14}I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archives.

344
00:31:22,805 --> 00:31:26,104
看镖身的特殊切割就知道
{\fs14}It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away.

345
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,110
“分析机器人”只会看标志
{\fs14}Those analysis droids only focus on symbols.

346
00:31:29,246 --> 00:31:32,510
你们绝地武士应该多注重…
{\fs14}I should think that you Jedi would have more respect...

347
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:33,947
知识与智慧的区别
{\fs14}for the difference between knowledge and...

348
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:36,779
--
{\fs14}wisdom.

349
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:38,878
机器人会思考
{\fs14}Well, if droids could think...

350
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:41,048
我们还混什么
{\fs14}there'd be none of us here, would there?

351
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:43,987
我不了解卡密诺星，它是共和国的一员吗？
{\fs14}Kamino. I'm not familiar with it. Is it in the Republic?

352
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:46,062
不，它在外星系之外
{\fs14}No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

353
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:51,795
在厘希迈司外约12秒差的距离
{\fs14}I'd say about 12 parsecs outside the Rishi Maze.

354
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:55,430
连资料库机器人都不难找到它
{\fs14}Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives.

355
00:31:57,407 --> 00:32:02,140
卡密诺人…离群索居
{\fs14}These Kaminoans keep to themselves.

356
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:05,112
他们是克隆人，非常优异
{\fs14}They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

357
00:32:05,283 --> 00:32:08,377
- 这些复制人友善吗？ - 视情况而定
{\fs14}- Cloners. Are they friendly?- Depends.

358
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:10,720
视什么情况，德克斯？
{\fs14}Depends on what, Dex?

359
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:13,689
视你的态度以及…
{\fs14}On how good your manners are...

360
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:18,091
你口袋里的钞票而定
{\fs14}and how big your... pocketbook is.

361
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,536
- 是你要求协助的吗？ - 是的
{\fs14}- Did you call for assistance?- Yes, I did.

362
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:32,769
有问题吗，肯诺比大师？
{\fs14}Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?

363
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:36,177
我想找卡密诺行星系统…
{\fs14}Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino.

364
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:38,545
但不在档案图库里面
{\fs14}It doesn't show up on the archive charts.

365
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,950
我对卡密诺星系不熟
{\fs14}Kamino. It's not a system I'm familiar with.

366
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:44,421
你座标没弄错吧？
{\fs14}Are you sure you have the right coordinates?

367
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:47,516
根据资料，应该在这个象限里
{\fs14}According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here...

368
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:49,686
紧临厘希迈司南边
{\fs14}just south of the Rishi Maze.

369
00:32:56,636 --> 00:32:59,969
你寻找的星系似乎
{\fs14}I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for...

370
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:01,768
不存在
{\fs14}doesn't exist.

371
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,367
不可能，除非档案资料不完整
{\fs14}Impossible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

372
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:07,538
档案里没有
{\fs14}If an item does not appear in our records...

373
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:09,707
就一定不存在
{\fs14}it does not exist.

374
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:32,735
你！不招待机器人
{\fs14}Hey, you! No droids!

375
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:35,008
出去！
{\fs14}Get outta here!

376
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,715
谢谢你，R2
{\fs14}Thank you, R2.

377
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,420
绝地武士的生活一定相当清苦
{\fs14}Must be difficult, having sworn your life to the Jedi...

378
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:51,424
行动、行事都受到限制
{\fs14}not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.

379
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:53,653
也不能跟所爱的人在一起
{\fs14}Or be with the people that I love.

380
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,621
你可以爱人吗？
{\fs14}Are you allowed to love?

381
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:57,562
我以为绝地武士是不准动情的
{\fs14}I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

382
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:03,401
不得爱恋
{\fs14}Attachment is forbidden.

383
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:07,107
不得拥有
{\fs14}Possession is forbidden.

384
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:10,804
慈悲心…我定义成无私的爱…
{\fs14}Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love...

385
00:34:10,913 --> 00:34:13,347
是绝地武士的中心思想
{\fs14}is central to a Jedi's life.

386
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:19,187
所以可以解释为…“爱心广被”
{\fs14}So you might say that we are encouraged to love.

387
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,223
你变好多
{\fs14}You've changed so much.

388
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,885
你一点都没变
{\fs14}You haven't changed a bit.

389
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:26,861
跟我梦中的你一模一样
{\fs14}You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.

390
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,240
探索，感受周遭的原力
{\fs14}Reach out. Sense the Force around you.

391
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:45,043
一定要运用你的感觉
{\fs14}Use your feelings you must.

392
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,480
年轻人！年轻人！
{\fs14}Younglings. Younglings!

393
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,024
有客人来访
{\fs14}A visitor we have.

394
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,993
哈罗，欧比王大师
{\fs14}Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

395
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,562
--
{\fs14}Hello.

396
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,188
抱歉打扰，大师
{\fs14}I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

397
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,631
有何指教，欧比王？
{\fs14}What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

398
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:07,004
我在找一个老朋友介绍的行星
{\fs14}I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.

399
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:10,234
但该星系不在档案地图里
{\fs14}I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps.

400
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,677
欧比王找不到一颗行星，真糗
{\fs14}Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

401
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,748
真糗啊！
{\fs14}How embarrassing!

402
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,176
连恩，拉上窗帘
{\fs14}Liam, the shades.

403
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:25,023
围在地图仪四周
{\fs14}Gather round the map reader.

404
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,286
清理你们的思绪
{\fs14}Clear your minds...

405
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:30,852
我们就会找到欧比王要的行星
{\fs14}and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.

406
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:35,228
它应该在…这里，
{\fs14}It ought to be here...

407
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,235
但却找不到
{\fs14}but it isn't.

408
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:40,773
这区的重力将星球都吸往这点
{\fs14}Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.

409
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,468
重力作用存在，
{\fs14}Gravity's silhouette remains...

410
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,546
但所有星体…
{\fs14}but the star and all the planets...

411
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,638
却消失无踪
{\fs14}disappeared they have.

412
00:35:48,749 --> 00:35:50,876
怎么会这样？
{\fs14}How can this be?

413
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,713
想想看？
{\fs14}A thought?

414
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,520
谁有答案？
{\fs14}Anyone.

415
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:58,424
大师
{\fs14}Master?

416
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:01,393
有人在记忆体里将它清除掉
{\fs14}Because someone erased it from the archive memory.

417
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:08,634
这孩子果然聪明
{\fs14}Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

418
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,769
这小徒弟说对了
{\fs14}The Padawan is right.

419
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:16,934
前往重力作用的中心点
{\fs14}Go to the center of gravity's pull...

420
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:20,502
你就会找到你要的行星
{\fs14}and find your planet you will.

421
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,912
资料一定是被删除了
{\fs14}The data must have been erased.

422
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:33,123
谁做的？不太可能，不是吗？
{\fs14}But who could empty information from the archives? Isn't that impossible?

423
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:35,629
的确是危机重重、疑云密布
{\fs14}Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.

424
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:40,100
删除者必定是位绝地武士
{\fs14}Only a Jedi could have erased those files.

425
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:43,604
谁？为什么？则更难回答
{\fs14}But who and why, harder to answer.

426
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:47,540
让我好好沉思一番
{\fs14}Meditate on this I will.

427
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,699
我并非最年轻的民选女王
{\fs14}I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected...

428
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:16,399
但现在回想起来，可能真的太年轻。
{\fs14}but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough.

429
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:18,476
不够有把握
{\fs14}I'm not sure I was ready.

430
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:21,101
你的同胞认为你很称职
{\fs14}The people you served thought you did a good job.

431
00:37:21,513 --> 00:37:24,572
为了让你续任还企图修订宪法
{\fs14}I heard they even tried to amend the constitution...

432
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:25,740
两任届满后终于得以退休
{\fs14}so you could stay in office.

433
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,341
两任届满后终于得以退休
{\fs14}I was relieved when my two terms were up.

434
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:32,150
但继任女王要我当参议员
{\fs14}But when the queen asked me to serve as senator...

435
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:34,248
我实在无法拒绝
{\fs14}I couldn't refuse her.

436
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:37,893
我赞同她，共和国需要你
{\fs14}I agree with her. I think the Republic needs you.

437
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:42,125
很高兴你继续为国服务
{\fs14}I'm glad that you chose to serve.

438
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,701
参议院若同意建军会引发内战
{\fs14}If the senate votes to create an army, it's sure to push us into a civil war.

439
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,675
不敢想像
{\fs14}It's unthinkable!

440
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:57,180
共和国成立后未曾有过战争
{\fs14}There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.

441
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:59,751
和谈不能
{\fs14}Do you see any way through negotiations...

442
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:01,945
挽回分离主义者吗？
{\fs14}to bring the separatists back into the Republic?

443
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:04,249
除非感受到威胁不然不会同意
{\fs14}Not if they feel threatened.

444
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:07,723
我想他们会向贸易联盟或商业协会求救
{\fs14}They'll turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help.

445
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:08,794
可耻，
{\fs14}It's outrageous...

446
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:11,193
最高法院已四度审判…
{\fs14}but after four trials in the Supreme Court...

447
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:15,098
纽特甘雷仍稳坐贸易联盟总督
{\fs14}Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation.

448
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:19,195
恐怕参议院无力解决此次危机
{\fs14}I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.

449
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,502
对共和国要有信心
{\fs14}We must keep our faith in the Republic.

450
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:33,444
丧失民主信心就是失败的到来
{\fs14}The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.

451
00:38:33,554 --> 00:38:36,250
希望这天永远不会来
{\fs14}Let's pray that day never comes.

452
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:39,019
同时，我们也得顾虑你的安全
{\fs14}In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.

453
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,124
你有何建议，绝地大师？
{\fs14}What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

454
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,597
安纳金还不是绝地武士，他还在学徒阶段。
{\fs14}Anakin's not a Jedi yet. He's still a Padawan learner.

455
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,565
- 我认为… - 等一下
{\fs14}- But I was thinking... - Hold on a minute.

456
00:38:47,668 --> 00:38:48,930
抱歉
{\fs14}Excuse me.

457
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:51,470
我想我该待在千湖区
{\fs14}I was thinking I would stay in the lake country.

458
00:38:51,572 --> 00:38:52,802
那里有些地方非常隐密
{\fs14}There are some places up there that are very isolated.

459
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:56,668
抱歉！安全问题由我负责
{\fs14}Excuse me. I'm in charge of security here, milady.

460
00:38:56,845 --> 00:38:59,766
这里是我的故乡，我清楚，这也是为什么我们要回来
{\fs14}And this is my home. I know it very well. That is why we're here.

461
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:01,816
此事最好
{\fs14}I think it would be wise...

462
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:04,317
善用我的知识
{\fs14}if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.

463
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:07,587
对不起，殿下
{\fs14}Sorry, milady.

464
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,919
很好，就这么决定
{\fs14}Perfect. It's settled, then.

465
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,638
在那儿，R4，正处于
{\fs14}There it is, R4, right where it should be.

466
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:30,576
失踪的位置…卡密诺
{\fs14}Our missing planet Kamino.

467
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:09,616
绝地大师
{\fs14}Master Jedi.

468
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:13,086
首相恭候大驾光临
{\fs14}The prime minister is expecting you.

469
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:15,725
- 等我？ - 当然
{\fs14}- I'm expected? - Of course.

470
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:18,892
他急着见你呢
{\fs14}He is anxious to meet you.

471
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:21,192
经过这么多年后…
{\fs14}After all these years...

472
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:24,894
我们以为你不会来了，
{\fs14}we were beginning to think you weren't coming.

473
00:40:25,003 --> 00:40:27,233
这边请
{\fs14}Now, please, this way.

474
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:41,509
容我引见拉玛苏
{\fs14}May I present Lama Su...

475
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,645
卡密诺的首相
{\fs14}prime minister of Kamino.

476
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:47,450
这位是绝地大师…
{\fs14}And this is Master Jedi...

477
00:40:47,693 --> 00:40:49,593
欧比王肯诺比
{\fs14}Obi-Wan Kenobi.

478
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:52,994
希望你感到不虚此行
{\fs14}I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.

479
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:55,435
请坐
{\fs14}Please.

480
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,265
我们来谈正事吧
{\fs14}And now to business.

481
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:03,309
你一定很高兴进度完全正常
{\fs14}You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule.

482
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:06,311
已完成20万单位
{\fs14}200,000 units are ready...

483
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:08,779
另有一百万个正在生产中
{\fs14}with a million more well on the way.

484
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:11,884
真是…好消息
{\fs14}That's good news.

485
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:15,113
请转告西佛迪雅大师…
{\fs14}Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

486
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,589
他的订单我们会准时交货
{\fs14}that his order will be met on time.

487
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:20,660
对不起…哪位大师？
{\fs14}I'm sorry. Master...

488
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:23,388
绝地大师西佛迪雅还是…
{\fs14}Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

489
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:26,626
绝地议会的首席，不是吗？
{\fs14}a leading member of theJedi Council, is he not?

490
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,534
西佛迪雅大师十年前就遇害了
{\fs14}Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.

491
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:34,505
哦，我深感遗憾
{\fs14}I'm so sorry to hear that.

492
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:38,909
他一定会因为我为他建造的军队感到骄傲
{\fs14}But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him.

493
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,345
军队？
{\fs14}The army?

494
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:44,112
是的，复制人大军。可以说是
{\fs14}Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

495
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:46,414
我们所造最精良的一批
{\fs14}one of the finest we've ever created.

496
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:48,523
--
{\fs14}Tell me, Prime Minister...

497
00:41:48,624 --> 00:41:51,115
我们大师订制这支部队时…
{\fs14}when my master first contacted you about the army...

498
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:53,353
曾说明用途吗？
{\fs14}did he say who it was for?

499
00:41:53,462 --> 00:41:55,487
当然有
{\fs14}Of course he did.

500
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,259
是要供共和国使用的
{\fs14}This army is for the Republic.

501
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:02,729
但你一定急着亲自点阅
{\fs14}But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.

502
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:05,365
正是我此行的目的
{\fs14}That's why I'm here.

503
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:27,356
学生时代常来此地静修
{\fs14}We used to come here for school retreat.

504
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,192
每天游到那个小岛
{\fs14}We would swim to that island every day.

505
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:34,471
我很喜欢这里的水
{\fs14}I love the water.

506
00:42:39,243 --> 00:42:42,872
躺在沙滩上作日光浴
{\fs14}We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us...

507
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:45,316
猜爱唱歌鸟儿的名字
{\fs14}and try to guess the names of the birds singing.

508
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:50,211
我不喜欢沙子
{\fs14}I don't like sand.

509
00:42:50,922 --> 00:42:54,653
又粗又乱使人过敏…
{\fs14}It's coarse and rough and irritating...

510
00:42:55,026 --> 00:42:57,051
还沾得到处是
{\fs14}and it gets everywhere.

511
00:42:59,264 --> 00:43:01,289
不像这里
{\fs14}Not like here.

512
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:03,901
到处都很柔软…
{\fs14}Here, everything is soft...

513
00:43:05,037 --> 00:43:07,232
光滑
{\fs14}and smooth.

514
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:44,470
不行
{\fs14}No.

515
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:47,170
我不该这么做
{\fs14}I shouldn't have done that.

516
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:50,884
对不起
{\fs14}I'm sorry.

517
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:05,125
真壮观
{\fs14}Very impressive.

518
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:07,360
我想你会满意
{\fs14}I'd hoped you would be pleased.

519
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:12,996
克隆人具思考能力
{\fs14}Clones can think creatively.

520
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:17,009
你会发现他们比机器人好很多
{\fs14}You will find that they are immensely superior to droids.

521
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:25,186
战斗教育和训练课程，也令我们相当自傲
{\fs14}We take great pride in our combat education and training programs.

522
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:28,654
这一组是五年前开发出来的
{\fs14}This group was created about five years ago.

523
00:44:28,757 --> 00:44:30,816
你刚提过加速成长
{\fs14}You mentioned growth acceleration.

524
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:32,860
那是必要的
{\fs14}Oh, yes, it's essential.

525
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,988
不然…，要等一辈子，克隆人才能成熟
{\fs14}Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow.

526
00:44:36,098 --> 00:44:38,692
现在只需要一半时间
{\fs14}Now we can do it in half the time.

527
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,463
我明白了
{\fs14}I see.

528
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,470
绝对服从
{\fs14}They are totally obedient...

529
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:46,268
绝不怀疑命令
{\fs14}taking any order without question.

530
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,034
我们做了些基因改造…
{\fs14}We modified their genetic structure...

531
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,775
让他们比母体较不具独立性
{\fs14}to make them less independent than the original host.

532
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,405
他们的原始母体是谁？
{\fs14}And who was the original host?

533
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,609
赏金猎人强格费特
{\fs14}A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

534
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,313
他现在在哪里？
{\fs14}And where is this bounty hunter now?

535
00:44:59,422 --> 00:45:01,549
我们将他留在此地
{\fs14}Oh, we keep him here.

536
00:45:04,227 --> 00:45:07,060
除了巨额酬庸…
{\fs14}Apart from his pay, which is considerable...

537
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,654
费特只要求一件事
{\fs14}Fett demanded only one thing:

538
00:45:09,766 --> 00:45:12,360
为他保留一个未改造的克隆人
{\fs14}An unaltered clone for himself.

539
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:14,903
- 奇怪吧？ - 未改造？
{\fs14}- Curious, isn't it? - "Unaltered"?

540
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:16,830
纯正基因的复制品
{\fs14}Pure genetic replication.

541
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:19,804
基因未曾驯化成较温和
{\fs14}No tampering with the structure to make it more docile...

542
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,470
而且也不经加速成长处理
{\fs14}and no growth acceleration.

543
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,811
我想见见这位强格费特
{\fs14}I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.

544
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,215
非常乐意为你安排
{\fs14}I would be very happy to arrange it for you.

545
00:45:45,804 --> 00:45:48,602
壮观吧？
{\fs14}Magnificent, aren't they?

546
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,365
我不知道
{\fs14}I don't know.

547
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,731
你当然知道，只是不跟我说
{\fs14}Sure you do. You just don't want to tell me.

548
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,905
你要用绝地念力控制我？
{\fs14}You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?

549
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:03,401
那只对心智虚弱者有效
{\fs14}They only work on the weak-minded.

550
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:06,472
好吧
{\fs14}All right.

551
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,441
我当时12岁，他叫帕罗
{\fs14}I was 12. His name was Palo.

552
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:11,340
我们参加青少年立法训练营
{\fs14}We were both in the Legislative Youth Program.

553
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:14,511
他比我大几岁，很可爱
{\fs14}He was a few years older than I. Very cute.

554
00:46:14,621 --> 00:46:17,487
黑色卷发，迷鞯难凵
{\fs14}Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

555
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,081
好，我有概念了
{\fs14}All right, I get the picture.

556
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:20,859
他后来怎么了？
{\fs14}Whatever happened to him?

557
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,791
我从事公共服务，他当艺术家
{\fs14}I went into public service. He went on to become an artist.

558
00:46:23,827 --> 00:46:25,856
或许他比较聪明
{\fs14}Maybe he was the smart one.

559
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:28,230
你真的不喜欢政治人物？
{\fs14}You really don't like politicians, do you?

560
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:30,496
有二、三个喜欢的…
{\fs14}I like two or three...

561
00:46:30,604 --> 00:46:32,663
但有一个我还不太清楚
{\fs14}but I'm not really sure about one of them.

562
00:46:35,684 --> 00:46:37,879
我不觉得政府体系有任何功效
{\fs14}I don't think the system works.

563
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:40,580
你认为怎么样才有功效？
{\fs14}How would you have it work?

564
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:44,923
政治人物应该坐下来讨论问题
{\fs14}We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem...

565
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,885
根据人民的最高利益去做
{\fs14}agree what's in the best interest of all the people...

566
00:46:47,996 --> 00:46:49,461
去做
{\fs14}and then do it.

567
00:46:49,465 --> 00:46:51,728
这正是我们的做法
{\fs14}That's exactly what we do.

568
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,824
问题是，人民不会永远同意
{\fs14}The trouble is that people don't always agree.

569
00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:55,869
应该说服他们
{\fs14}Well, then they should be made to.

570
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:59,031
- 谁去说服？ - 我怎么知道…某人
{\fs14}- By whom? Who's gonna make them? - I don't know. Someone.

571
00:46:59,141 --> 00:47:01,066
- 你？ - 当然不
{\fs14}- You? - Of course not me.

572
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:04,278
- 但一定有某个人 - 某个有智慧的人
{\fs14}- But someone. - Someone wise.

573
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:07,179
听起来颇像独裁政权
{\fs14}Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

574
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:11,248
只要是具有功效
{\fs14}Well, if it works.

575
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:19,424
- 你在开我玩笑 - No
{\fs14}- You're making fun of me. - No.

576
00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:22,489
我可不敢捉弄参议员大人
{\fs14}I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.

577
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:03,325
安纳？你还好吧？
{\fs14}Ani, are you all right?

578
00:48:36,672 --> 00:48:40,598
波巴，你父亲在吗？
{\fs14}Boba, is your father here?

579
00:48:40,643 --> 00:48:41,732
在
{\fs14}Yep.

580
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:43,903
可以见他吗？
{\fs14}May we see him?

581
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,845
当然
{\fs14}Sure.

582
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:50,578
爸，道维来找你
{\fs14}Dad, Taun We's here.

583
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:05,234
强格，欢迎回来
{\fs14}Jango, welcome back.

584
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:07,503
这趟旅行收获丰富吗？
{\fs14}Was your trip productive?

585
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:08,938
还好
{\fs14}Fairly.

586
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,474
这位是绝地大师欧比王肯诺比
{\fs14}This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

587
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:15,375
他来视察进度的
{\fs14}He's come to check on our progress.

588
00:49:15,713 --> 00:49:18,614
你的复制人很棒，你一定感到相当骄傲
{\fs14}Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.

589
00:49:18,716 --> 00:49:21,708
只是在宇宙中混口饭吃
{\fs14}I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.

590
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,517
你曾经到过科罗森吗？
{\fs14}Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?

591
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:28,517
- 一、二次吧 - 最近呢？
{\fs14}- Once or twice. - Recently?

592
00:49:30,662 --> 00:49:32,357
有可能
{\fs14}Possibly.

593
00:49:32,464 --> 00:49:34,557
那你一定认识西佛迪雅大师
{\fs14}Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

594
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,395
波巴，把门关上
{\fs14}Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

595
00:49:41,407 --> 00:49:42,806
哪位大师？
{\fs14}Master who?

596
00:49:44,844 --> 00:49:46,869
西佛迪雅
{\fs14}Sifo-Dyas.

597
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:49,607
不是他聘雇你做这项工作吗？
{\fs14}Is he not theJedi who hired you for this job?

598
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:54,450
没听说过他
{\fs14}Never heard of him.

599
00:49:57,356 --> 00:49:58,448
真的？
{\fs14}Really?

600
00:49:59,592 --> 00:50:03,551
柏格登卫星的提拉诺斯聘我的
{\fs14}I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.

601
00:50:03,662 --> 00:50:05,289
奇怪
{\fs14}Curious.

602
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:10,565
军队你还满意吗？
{\fs14}Do you like your army?

603
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:13,339
我想看他们的战斗表现
{\fs14}I look forward to seeing them in action.

604
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:18,009
骁勇善战，我保证
{\fs14}They'll do their job well. I'll guarantee that.

605
00:50:18,111 --> 00:50:20,238
多谢接见，强格
{\fs14}Thank you for your time, Jango.

606
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:24,108
我一向乐于接待绝地武士
{\fs14}Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

607
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:43,767
怎么回事，爸？
{\fs14}What is it, Dad?

608
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,631
收拾行李，我们得离开
{\fs14}Pack your things. We're leaving.

609
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,374
找到他们后，我们激烈的争辩一番
{\fs14}And when I got to them, we went into aggressive negotiations.

610
00:50:56,485 --> 00:50:58,510
怎么个“激烈的争辩”？
{\fs14}"Aggressive negotiations"? What's that?

611
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,112
呃…用光剑争辩
{\fs14}Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

612
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:18,231
如果被欧比王看到我这样做，他会抓狂
{\fs14}If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

613
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,833
自从与你相识…
{\fs14}From the moment I met you...

614
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,100
好多年以前的事了…
{\fs14}all those years ago...

615
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:54,534
我没有一天不想你
{\fs14}not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

616
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,681
今天再度与你相遇…
{\fs14}And now that I'm with you again...

617
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:01,410
我反而觉得很痛苦
{\fs14}I'm in agony.

618
00:52:04,823 --> 00:52:08,691
越接近你就越痛苦
{\fs14}The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

619
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,227
一想到不能跟你在一起…
{\fs14}The thought of not being with you...

620
00:52:12,097 --> 00:52:14,031
连气都快喘不过来
{\fs14}I can't breathe.

621
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,836
我仍被你的吻迷惑着
{\fs14}I'm haunted by the kiss...

622
00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:22,907
你不该吻我的
{\fs14}that you should never have given me.

623
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,673
我内心惴惴不安…
{\fs14}My heart is beating...

624
00:52:25,777 --> 00:52:28,712
希望它不会变成爱的伤痕
{\fs14}hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.

625
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,816
你在我灵魂深处
{\fs14}You are in my very soul...

626
00:52:32,918 --> 00:52:34,943
折磨着我
{\fs14}tormenting me.

627
00:52:37,423 --> 00:52:40,915
我该怎么办呢？只要你说，我一定照做。
{\fs14}What can I do? I will do anything that you ask.

628
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:54,466
如果你跟我一样深受折磨…，请你说出来。
{\fs14}If you are suffering as much as I am, please, tell me.

629
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,243
我不能说
{\fs14}I can't.

630
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:02,406
我们不能在一起，不可能的
{\fs14}We can't. It's... just not possible.

631
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:05,508
什么事都有可能，听我说…
{\fs14}Anything is possible, Padmé. Listen to me.

632
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,644
不，你听我说
{\fs14}No, you listen.

633
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:11,883
我们活在现实世界，醒来吧
{\fs14}We live in a real world. Come back to it.

634
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:15,655
你专心学习当绝地武士…，我当我的参议员
{\fs14}You're studying to become a Jedi. I'm a senator.

635
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:19,055
跟着你的感觉走下去的话…
{\fs14}If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion...

636
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:21,635
只会走到无法收拾的地步…
{\fs14}it'll take us to a place we cannot go...

637
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:25,134
不管我们对彼此有什么感觉
{\fs14}regardless of the way we feel about each other.

638
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:27,264
这么说，你也有感觉
{\fs14}Then you do feel something.

639
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:30,401
我不会让你为我放弃前途
{\fs14}I will not let you give up your future for me.

640
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:32,672
你要我保持理智
{\fs14}You are asking me to be rational.

641
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:35,079
这一点我做不到
{\fs14}That is something I know I cannot do.

642
00:53:35,184 --> 00:53:39,814
但愿我能忘却这份感情…
{\fs14}Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings...

643
00:53:39,922 --> 00:53:41,947
但我做不到
{\fs14}but I can't.

644
00:53:42,891 --> 00:53:45,621
我不会儿女情长的
{\fs14}I will not give in to this.

645
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:53,965
你知道吗…
{\fs14}Well, you know...

646
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,903
事情不一定非这样不可
{\fs14}it wouldn't have to be that way.

647
00:53:57,006 --> 00:53:59,839
我们可以偷偷相爱
{\fs14}We could keep it a secret.

648
00:54:01,277 --> 00:54:03,268
那我们必须活在谎言中
{\fs14}We'd be living a lie...

649
00:54:03,379 --> 00:54:05,677
纸是包不住火的
{\fs14}one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.

650
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:09,081
我不能这么做
{\fs14}I couldn't do that.

651
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:12,052
你可以吗？过那种日子？
{\fs14}Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?

652
00:54:14,023 --> 00:54:17,015
不可以，你说得对
{\fs14}No. You're right.

653
00:54:17,528 --> 00:54:19,696
我们会被毁了
{\fs14}It would destroy us.

654
00:54:26,971 --> 00:54:30,873
告诉议会，第一支军队备妥了
{\fs14}Tell your council that the first battalions are ready.

655
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:34,369
提醒他们，如果需要更多军队
{\fs14}And remind them, if they need more troops...

656
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:37,641
将需要更多时间培育他们
{\fs14}it will take more time to grow them.

657
00:54:37,748 --> 00:54:39,511
谨记在心，多谢
{\fs14}I won't forget, and thank you.

658
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:41,448
谢谢
{\fs14}Thank you.

659
00:54:56,735 --> 00:54:58,862
R4！
{\fs14}R4!

660
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:02,269
用第5密码加密传讯到科罗森，收件人写“养老院”
{\fs14}Scramble code five to Coruscant, care of the old folks' home!

661
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:11,180
我跟卡密诺首相碰过面
{\fs14}I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino.

662
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:15,186
他们用赏金猎人强格费特，作为母体制造一支复制人大军
{\fs14}They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army.

663
00:55:15,288 --> 00:55:17,756
我觉得这位赏金猎人
{\fs14}I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter...

664
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:19,984
就是刺客
{\fs14}is the assassin we are looking for.

665
00:55:20,092 --> 00:55:22,060
你认为订制复制人的人…
{\fs14}Do you think these cloners are involved...

666
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:24,220
跟刺杀阴谋有关？
{\fs14}in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

667
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,231
不，大师，似乎无此动机
{\fs14}No, Master. There appears to be no motive.

668
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:30,234
不要假设，欧比王
{\fs14}Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

669
00:55:30,336 --> 00:55:33,305
一定要先清除杂念…
{\fs14}Clear your mind must be...

670
00:55:33,439 --> 00:55:36,603
如果你想查出幕后的主谋
{\fs14}if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.

671
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,575
是的，大师
{\fs14}Yes, Master.

672
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:41,739
他们说：复制人是西佛迪雅大师订制的
{\fs14}They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army...

673
00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:45,444
根据十年前参议院的要求
{\fs14}at the request of the senate almost ten years ago.

674
00:55:48,322 --> 00:55:51,189
印象中，他在那之前已遇害
{\fs14}I was under the impression he was killed before that.

675
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:54,783
绝地议会有授权订制复制人？
{\fs14}Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?

676
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:56,795
没有，不管订制者是谁
{\fs14}No. Whoever placed that order...

677
00:55:56,897 --> 00:55:58,195
绝地议会并未授权
{\fs14}did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.

678
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:02,928
带他来，我们当面对质
{\fs14}Bring him here. Question him we will.

679
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:06,139
是的，找到他后再行报告
{\fs14}Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him.

680
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:11,403
我们真是盲目啊，竟然不知
{\fs14}Blind we are if creation of this clone army...

681
00:56:11,512 --> 00:56:13,639
复制人悄悄在生产
{\fs14}we could not see.

682
00:56:17,018 --> 00:56:19,213
我们得通知参议院，我们…
{\fs14}I think it is time we informed the senate...

683
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,345
运用原力的能力已大为减弱
{\fs14}that our ability to use the Force has diminished.

684
00:56:21,723 --> 00:56:25,557
只有西斯的黑暗大帝，明t我们的弱点
{\fs14}Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness.

685
00:56:25,694 --> 00:56:27,958
通知参议院…
{\fs14}If informed the senate is...

686
00:56:28,063 --> 00:56:30,531
只会让我们的处境更加窘迫
{\fs14}multiply our adversaries will.

687
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:33,794
--
{\fs14}No.

688
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:39,207
妈…不…不要！
{\fs14}Mom, no.

689
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:08,033
不要走
{\fs14}Don't go.

690
00:57:10,074 --> 00:57:12,042
我不想打扰你
{\fs14}I don't want to disturb you.

691
00:57:13,377 --> 00:57:15,345
你的出现有安抚作用
{\fs14}Your presence is soothing.

692
00:57:18,249 --> 00:57:20,342
你昨晚又作恶梦了
{\fs14}You had another nightmare last night.

693
00:57:21,552 --> 00:57:23,918
绝地武士不会作恶梦
{\fs14}Jedi don't have nightmares.

694
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:26,446
我听见了
{\fs14}I heard you.

695
00:57:30,395 --> 00:57:32,386
我梦见我的母亲
{\fs14}I saw my mother.

696
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,459
她正受着苦，帕米
{\fs14}She is suffering, Padmé.

697
00:57:39,938 --> 00:57:43,135
见到她跟见到你一样清晰
{\fs14}I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

698
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:55,978
她很痛苦
{\fs14}She is in pain.

699
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,991
我知道这会违抗保护你的命令
{\fs14}I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator...

700
00:58:00,193 --> 00:58:02,584
但，我得去一趟
{\fs14}but I have to go.

701
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:06,556
我必须去救她
{\fs14}I have to help her.

702
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:10,168
我跟你一起去
{\fs14}I'll go with you.

703
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,568
很抱歉，我别无选择
{\fs14}I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

704
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,515
爸！你看！
{\fs14}Dad, look!

705
00:58:26,153 --> 00:58:28,587
波巴，快上船！
{\fs14}Boba, get on board!

706
00:59:41,865 --> 00:59:43,560
不妙
{\fs14}Oh, not good.

707
01:01:48,063 --> 01:01:49,396
在这里等着
{\fs14}Wait right there.

708
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,689
--
{\fs14}Okey-okey.

709
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:55,730
你好，瓦头
{\fs14}Chut-chut, Watto.

710
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:00,000
我来帮你忙
{\fs14}Let me help you with that.

711
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:03,476
什么？你想干嘛？
{\fs14}What? What do you want?

712
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:06,047
等等，你是绝地武士
{\fs14}Wait! You're a Jedi!

713
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:09,345
不管是什么问题，不是我干的
{\fs14}Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

714
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:17,218
我来找西蜜天行者
{\fs14}I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

715
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:20,656
安纳？
{\fs14}Ani?

716
01:02:22,566 --> 01:02:24,329
小安纳？
{\fs14}Little Ani?

717
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:29,239
--
{\fs14}Nahhh.

718
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,737
是安纳！真的是你！
{\fs14}You are Ani! It is you!

719
01:02:34,145 --> 01:02:37,410
长好高了
{\fs14}You sure sprouted, huh?

720
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:40,774
绝地武士！真是个惊喜
{\fs14}A Jedi! Whattaya know!

721
01:02:44,055 --> 01:02:47,957
或许可以帮我催收些烂帐
{\fs14}Maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

722
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:49,526
我母亲呢？
{\fs14}My mother.

723
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:52,118
哦，对了，西蜜
{\fs14}Oh, yeah. Shmi.

724
01:02:53,598 --> 01:02:56,829
她不归我了，我将她卖了
{\fs14}She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

725
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:59,232
- 卖了？ - 很多年了
{\fs14}- You sold her? - Years ago.

726
01:02:59,337 --> 01:03:02,431
抱歉，安纳，生意归生意
{\fs14}Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business.

727
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:06,340
卖给个水气收集农夫，叫拉斯
{\fs14}I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.

728
01:03:06,445 --> 01:03:08,470
我记得应该是拉斯
{\fs14}At least I think it was Lars.

729
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:12,072
信不信由你，听说他给她自由并跟她结婚了！
{\fs14}Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her!

730
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:14,482
想不到有这种好事吧
{\fs14}Can ya beat that, eh?

731
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:19,048
知不知道他们现在在哪？
{\fs14}Do you know where they are now?

732
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:21,059
离这儿很远
{\fs14}Long way from here.

733
01:03:21,161 --> 01:03:25,655
应该在摩斯艾斯里港的那头吧
{\fs14}Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think.

734
01:03:25,765 --> 01:03:27,756
我想知道
{\fs14}I'd like to know.

735
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:32,166
没问题，当然！
{\fs14}Sure. Absolutely!

736
01:03:33,273 --> 01:03:35,298
去查查我的记录
{\fs14}Let's go look at my records, huh?

737
01:04:02,293 --> 01:04:05,553
爸！我们被跟踪了！
{\fs14}Dad! I think we're being tracked!

738
01:04:05,663 --> 01:04:09,099
一定有追踪器粘在我们船身上
{\fs14}He must have put a homing device on our hull.

739
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,398
坐好，我们将进入小行星群里
{\fs14}Hang on, son. We'll move into the asteroid field...

740
01:04:11,403 --> 01:04:13,636
让他开开眼界
{\fs14}and we'll have a couple of surprises for him.

741
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,818
震碎炮
{\fs14}Seismic charges!

742
01:04:25,918 --> 01:04:27,549
待命
{\fs14}Stand by.

743
01:04:51,378 --> 01:04:54,040
他好像还是不懂我的意思
{\fs14}He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.

744
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,898
小心！
{\fs14}Watch out!

745
01:05:32,654 --> 01:05:35,384
干掉他，爸！干掉他！发射！
{\fs14}Get him, Dad! Fire!

746
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:39,852
要命！我真恨飞行
{\fs14}Blast! This is why I hate flying!

747
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:00,405
打中了！
{\fs14}We got him!

748
01:06:00,516 --> 01:06:02,541
再给他致命的一击
{\fs14}We'll just have to finish him.

749
01:06:26,977 --> 01:06:30,504
R4，准备抛弃备用零件
{\fs14}R4, prepare to jettison the spare part canisters.

750
01:06:34,518 --> 01:06:36,418
抛射！
{\fs14}Fire them now!

751
01:06:47,467 --> 01:06:50,935
再也不会见面了
{\fs14}We won't be seeing him again.

752
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:26,461
R4，我们等得够久了
{\fs14}Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough.

753
01:07:46,093 --> 01:07:49,995
联盟船舰不寻常的在此集结
{\fs14}There's an unusual concentration of Federation ships over there, R4.

754
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,067
在此留守，R2
{\fs14}Stay with the ship, R2.

755
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:43,585
哈罗，需要效劳吗？我是C…
{\fs14}Hello. How might I be of service? I am C...

756
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:45,587
3PO？
{\fs14}3PO?

757
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,322
创造者！
{\fs14}The maker!

758
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:51,053
噢，安纳主人！
{\fs14}Master Ani!

759
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:53,959
我就知道你会回来！
{\fs14}I knew you would return. I knew it!

760
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:55,826
还有帕米小姐，噢，天啊
{\fs14}And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

761
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:57,524
哈罗，3PO
{\fs14}Hello, 3PO.

762
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:01,536
上苍保佑，真高兴见到二位
{\fs14}Bless my circuits! I'm so pleased to see you both.

763
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,606
我来找我母亲的
{\fs14}I've come to see my mother.

764
01:09:04,442 --> 01:09:07,467
我们进去屋里吧
{\fs14}I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

765
01:09:09,447 --> 01:09:13,941
欧文主人，为你介绍两位贵客
{\fs14}Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors.

766
01:09:14,051 --> 01:09:16,349
我是安纳金天行者
{\fs14}I'm Anakin Skywalker.

767
01:09:17,622 --> 01:09:19,249
欧文拉斯
{\fs14}Owen Lars.

768
01:09:19,357 --> 01:09:21,552
- 我女朋友蓓鲁 - Hello
{\fs14}- This is my girlfriend, Beru. - Hello.

769
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:23,650
我叫帕米
{\fs14}I'm Padmé.

770
01:09:23,828 --> 01:09:25,428
我应该是你的同母异父弟弟吧
{\fs14}I guess I'm your stepbrother.

771
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:28,431
我一直感觉有一天你会来
{\fs14}I had a feeling you might show up someday.

772
01:09:29,201 --> 01:09:30,930
我母亲在吗？
{\fs14}Is my mother here?

773
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:32,765
不，她不在
{\fs14}No, she's not.

774
01:09:33,972 --> 01:09:35,701
克里格拉斯
{\fs14}Cliegg Lars.

775
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:37,798
西蜜是我太太
{\fs14}Shmi is my wife.

776
01:09:38,911 --> 01:09:41,937
我们进去，有很多事情该谈谈。
{\fs14}We should go inside. We have a lot to talk about.

777
01:09:48,554 --> 01:09:51,998
就在黎明前夕，突然冒出
{\fs14}It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere.

778
01:09:52,058 --> 01:09:54,659
一群塔斯肯强盗
{\fs14}A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

779
01:09:55,662 --> 01:09:58,563
你母亲照例一大早起来…
{\fs14}Your mother had gone out early, like she always did...

780
01:09:58,665 --> 01:10:02,032
采收凝结器上的蘑菇
{\fs14}to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators.

781
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:06,296
从足迹看来，她回到半路上…
{\fs14}From the tracks, she was about halfway home...

782
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:08,306
却被掳走了
{\fs14}when they took her.

783
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:11,968
塔斯肯族走路像人，
{\fs14}Those Tuskens walk like men...

784
01:10:12,078 --> 01:10:16,674
可是他们很凶恶，是冷酷的怪物
{\fs14}but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

785
01:10:17,518 --> 01:10:20,544
30人前去营救，只有4人回来
{\fs14}Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back.

786
01:10:21,522 --> 01:10:25,652
我也想去，可是腿断了后…
{\fs14}I'd be out there with them, but after I lost my leg...

787
01:10:25,759 --> 01:10:31,391
无法驾驶，只好等痊K再想办法
{\fs14}I just couldn't ride anymore until I heal.

788
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:34,234
我不会放弃搜救
{\fs14}I don't want to give up on her...

789
01:10:34,335 --> 01:10:37,002
只是她失踪几个月了
{\fs14}but she's been gone a month.

790
01:10:37,104 --> 01:10:40,330
活存那么久的机会不大
{\fs14}There's little hope she's lasted this long.

791
01:10:44,112 --> 01:10:46,080
你要去哪里？
{\fs14}Where are you going?

792
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:48,406
去找我母亲
{\fs14}To find my mother.

793
01:10:48,818 --> 01:10:52,685
你母亲死了，接受事实吧
{\fs14}Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

794
01:11:12,843 --> 01:11:15,835
你留在这里
{\fs14}You're gonna have to stay here.

795
01:11:15,946 --> 01:11:18,608
他们是好人，没有危险
{\fs14}These are good people, Padmé. You'll be safe.

796
01:11:30,261 --> 01:11:33,229
我很快就回来
{\fs14}I won't be long.

797
01:13:18,205 --> 01:13:20,196
商业协会和
{\fs14}We must persuade the Commerce Guild...

798
01:13:20,307 --> 01:13:22,607
企业联盟必须签约
{\fs14}and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.

799
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:25,608
那卜星的参议员怎么对付？
{\fs14}What about the senator from Naboo?

800
01:13:25,747 --> 01:13:27,472
她还没死吗？
{\fs14}Is she dead yet?

801
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:31,942
除非看到她的头，否则我不签
{\fs14}I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk.

802
01:13:32,053 --> 01:13:34,351
我以信誉保证，总督
{\fs14}I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

803
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:37,516
有了我们打造的战斗机器人…
{\fs14}With these new battle droids we've built for you...

804
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:40,789
你拥有全银河最精良的部队
{\fs14}you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.

805
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,640
正如我先前解释过的…
{\fs14}As I explained to you earlier...

806
01:13:52,742 --> 01:13:55,973
又将有一万多个星系…
{\fs14}I am quite convinced that 10,000 more systems...

807
01:13:56,078 --> 01:13:58,876
加入我们的行动，只要你们肯支持
{\fs14}will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen.

808
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:02,750
你的提议可被视为叛国罪
{\fs14}What you are proposing could be construed as treason.

809
01:14:02,886 --> 01:14:05,515
科技联邦的机器人
{\fs14}The Techno Union army...

810
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:10,422
悉听您的差遣，伯爵
{\fs14}is at your disposal, Count.

811
01:14:11,295 --> 01:14:14,822
银行公会愿意签署条约
{\fs14}The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

812
01:14:14,932 --> 01:14:16,797
好，很好
{\fs14}Good. Very good.

813
01:14:17,935 --> 01:14:21,336
贸易联盟的朋友们已誓言支持
{\fs14}Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support...

814
01:14:21,705 --> 01:14:24,333
他们的战斗机器人加上你们的
{\fs14}and when their battle droids are combined with yours...

815
01:14:24,441 --> 01:14:27,467
我们将拥有银河最强大的军队
{\fs14}we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy.

816
01:14:27,612 --> 01:14:30,308
绝地武士根本不是对手
{\fs14}The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

817
01:14:31,082 --> 01:14:35,116
共和国将任凭我们宰割
{\fs14}The Republic will agree to any demands we make.

818
01:15:32,747 --> 01:15:34,738
妈？妈？
{\fs14}Mom?

819
01:15:37,184 --> 01:15:39,152
安纳
{\fs14}Ani?

820
01:15:40,388 --> 01:15:42,185
安纳
{\fs14}Ani?

821
01:15:42,424 --> 01:15:44,685
是你吗？
{\fs14}Is it you?

822
01:15:44,792 --> 01:15:48,753
我来找你了，妈。你安全了
{\fs14}I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

823
01:15:54,136 --> 01:15:58,105
很英俊
{\fs14}You look so handsome.

824
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:02,635
我的儿子
{\fs14}My son.

825
01:16:03,744 --> 01:16:05,508
我长大成人的儿子
{\fs14}My grown-up son.

826
01:16:07,049 --> 01:16:09,313
我以你为荣，安纳
{\fs14}I'm so proud of you, Ani.

827
01:16:09,418 --> 01:16:11,352
我好想你
{\fs14}I missed you.

828
01:16:14,089 --> 01:16:16,182
我死而无憾了
{\fs14}Now I am complete.

829
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:25,222
我爱你…
{\fs14}I love y...

830
01:16:25,435 --> 01:16:28,763
不要丢下我，妈，一切
{\fs14}Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

831
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:30,730
我爱…
{\fs14}I love...

832
01:16:32,275 --> 01:16:34,743
我爱…
{\fs14}I love...

833
01:17:29,834 --> 01:17:31,859
安纳金！
{\fs14}Anakin!

834
01:17:32,404 --> 01:17:33,871
不！
{\fs14}No!

835
01:17:53,259 --> 01:17:54,886
怎么回事？
{\fs14}What is it?

836
01:17:54,995 --> 01:17:58,453
痛苦…挣扎…
{\fs14}Pain, suffering...

837
01:17:59,032 --> 01:18:01,023
死亡，我感觉到了
{\fs14}death I feel.

838
01:18:05,572 --> 01:18:08,700
恐怖的事发生了
{\fs14}Something terrible has happened.

839
01:18:11,378 --> 01:18:14,404
年少天行者遭逢苦难
{\fs14}Young Skywalker is in pain...

840
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:16,379
极大的痛苦
{\fs14}terrible pain.

841
01:18:21,188 --> 01:18:24,817
传输器没故障，但毫无回音
{\fs14}The transmitter is working, but we're not receiving a return signal.

842
01:18:24,925 --> 01:18:27,655
科罗森太远，能加强功率吗？
{\fs14}Coruscant's too far. R4, can you boost the power?

843
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:30,220
我们得另外想办法
{\fs14}We'll have to try something else.

844
01:18:33,134 --> 01:18:35,932
尝试连络在那卜星的安纳金
{\fs14}Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo.

845
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:37,931
那儿近多了
{\fs14}It's much closer.

846
01:18:39,774 --> 01:18:42,072
安纳金？听得到吗？
{\fs14}Anakin, do you copy?

847
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:45,179
我是欧比王，安纳金？
{\fs14}This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

848
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:47,611
他不在那卜星上，R4
{\fs14}He's not on Naboo, R4.

849
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:51,345
我试试加大频宽
{\fs14}I'm going to try and widen the range.

850
01:18:53,755 --> 01:18:55,723
希望他没出什么乱子
{\fs14}I do hope nothing's happened to him.

851
01:19:03,232 --> 01:19:05,097
那是安纳金的追踪讯号
{\fs14}That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right...

852
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:07,702
但它来自塔图印
{\fs14}but it's coming from Tatooine.

853
01:19:08,271 --> 01:19:10,865
他去那里干什么？
{\fs14}What in the blazes is he doing there?

854
01:19:10,974 --> 01:19:12,942
跟他说过好好待在那卜星
{\fs14}I told him to stay on Naboo.

855
01:19:16,446 --> 01:19:18,141
我们没有什么时间
{\fs14}We haven't got much time.

856
01:19:18,248 --> 01:19:20,307
安纳金，听到吗？
{\fs14}Anakin, do you copy?

857
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:22,441
我是欧比王
{\fs14}This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

858
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,294
重新传输讯息
{\fs14}Retransmit this message...

859
01:19:34,364 --> 01:19:37,026
安纳金？听得到吗？
{\fs14}Anakin, do you copy?

860
01:19:37,133 --> 01:19:39,499
我的长程…故障
{\fs14}My long-range transmitter has been knocked out.

861
01:19:39,602 --> 01:19:41,934
本将讯息转传至科罗森
{\fs14}Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

862
01:20:23,482 --> 01:20:25,473
吃点东西吗？
{\fs14}I brought you something.

863
01:20:25,585 --> 01:20:27,712
饿不饿？
{\fs14}Are you hungry?

864
01:20:29,488 --> 01:20:31,456
排档杆坏了
{\fs14}The shifter broke.

865
01:20:33,326 --> 01:20:36,124
修东西时生活显得单纯多了
{\fs14}Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things.

866
01:20:38,564 --> 01:20:42,056
我对修理东西很在行，一向如此
{\fs14}I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

867
01:20:44,403 --> 01:20:45,371
但我不能…
{\fs14}But I couldn't...

868
01:20:49,376 --> 01:20:51,310
为什么她非死不可？
{\fs14}Why'd she have to die?

869
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:56,874
为什么我救不了她？
{\fs14}Why couldn't I save her?

870
01:20:57,017 --> 01:20:59,042
我可以的
{\fs14}I know I could have!

871
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:03,713
有时候天命难违
{\fs14}Sometimes there are things no one can fix.

872
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:07,755
- 你无法拥有无上的力量，安纳 - 我应该可以的
{\fs14}- You're not all-powerful, Ani. - Well, I should be!

873
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:12,522
有一天我一定可以
{\fs14}Someday I will be.

874
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:15,495
我会成为史上最强的绝地武士
{\fs14}I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

875
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,230
我说到做到
{\fs14}I promise you.

876
01:21:19,974 --> 01:21:22,340
甚至学会让人长生不老
{\fs14}I will even learn to stop people from dying.

877
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:30,107
都是欧比王的错！他嫉妒我！
{\fs14}It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous!

878
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,243
他阻碍我进步
{\fs14}He's holding me back!

879
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:37,683
怎么回事，安纳金？
{\fs14}What's wrong, Ani?

880
01:21:47,437 --> 01:21:49,405
我杀了他们
{\fs14}I killed them.

881
01:21:51,141 --> 01:21:53,109
我把他们全杀了
{\fs14}I killed them all.

882
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,844
他们都死了
{\fs14}They're dead.

883
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:59,039
一个都不留活口
{\fs14}Every single one of them.

884
01:22:01,184 --> 01:22:03,152
不只是男人…
{\fs14}And not just the men...

885
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:07,147
连妇女
{\fs14}but the women...

886
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:09,157
和小孩无一幸免
{\fs14}and the children too.

887
01:22:09,426 --> 01:22:11,685
他们跟野兽没什么两样！
{\fs14}They're like animals...

888
01:22:11,795 --> 01:22:13,927
我像杀野兽一样宰了他们！
{\fs14}and I slaughtered them like animals!

889
01:22:15,266 --> 01:22:17,257
我恨他们！
{\fs14}I hate them!

890
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:37,087
你这么愤怒是很正常的
{\fs14}To be angry is to be human.

891
01:22:37,188 --> 01:22:39,088
但我是绝地武士
{\fs14}I'm a Jedi.

892
01:22:40,191 --> 01:22:42,091
我知道我应该要看破一切
{\fs14}I know I'm better than this.

893
01:22:55,073 --> 01:22:59,601
我知道，不管你在哪里，那个地方都会变得更美好。
{\fs14}I know wherever you are it's become a better place.

894
01:22:59,711 --> 01:23:04,842
你是男人一生中，最难得的可爱伴侣
{\fs14}You were the most loving partner a man could ever have.

895
01:23:06,819 --> 01:23:08,844
再见了，亲爱的妻子
{\fs14}Good-bye, my darling wife.

896
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:14,793
也谢谢你
{\fs14}And thank you.

897
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:43,352
我不够强，没救到你，妈
{\fs14}I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom.

898
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:47,724
我还不够强
{\fs14}I wasn't strong enough.

899
01:23:51,299 --> 01:23:55,666
但我发誓，我以后不会再失败。
{\fs14}But I promise I won't fail again.

900
01:24:05,613 --> 01:24:07,672
我想你
{\fs14}I miss you...

901
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:10,950
我好想你
{\fs14}so much.

902
01:24:16,892 --> 01:24:19,588
R2，有什么事？
{\fs14}R2? What are you doing here?

903
01:24:22,498 --> 01:24:26,730
它好像收到一个叫欧比王肯诺比传来的讯息
{\fs14}It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

904
01:24:27,736 --> 01:24:30,864
安纳主人，听过这名字吗？
{\fs14}Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you?

905
01:24:33,008 --> 01:24:35,476
长程传输器故障
{\fs14}Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out.

906
01:24:35,578 --> 01:24:37,808
我将讯息转传至科罗森
{\fs14}Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

907
01:24:41,318 --> 01:24:43,548
我跟随赏金猎人强格费特…
{\fs14}I have tracked the bounty hunter, Jango Fett...

908
01:24:43,653 --> 01:24:45,814
来到机器人生产地吉诺西斯
{\fs14}to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

909
01:24:45,922 --> 01:24:49,551
贸易联盟到此点收机器人军队
{\fs14}The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here...

910
01:24:49,659 --> 01:24:51,650
很明显甘雷总督…
{\fs14}and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

911
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:55,253
是行刺艾米达拉议员的主谋
{\fs14}is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala.

912
01:24:55,365 --> 01:24:57,526
商业协会和企业联盟…
{\fs14}The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance...

913
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:01,297
双双带兵投靠杜酷伯爵，形成
{\fs14}have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming...

914
01:25:01,438 --> 01:25:03,463
等一下
{\fs14}Wait.

915
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:17,947
吉诺西斯进行着的阴谋，远比我们所知的严重。
{\fs14}More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed.

916
01:25:18,055 --> 01:25:19,818
我同意
{\fs14}I agree.

917
01:25:21,225 --> 01:25:23,523
我们会对付杜酷
{\fs14}We will deal with Count Dooku.

918
01:25:23,628 --> 01:25:27,189
你一定要留在目前的所在地
{\fs14}The most important thing for you is to stay where you are.

919
01:25:27,298 --> 01:25:30,028
尽全力保护参议员
{\fs14}Protect the senator at all costs.

920
01:25:30,134 --> 01:25:32,659
这是你的首要之务
{\fs14}That is your first priority.

921
01:25:33,105 --> 01:25:35,073
我懂，大师
{\fs14}Understood, Master.

922
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:37,107
他们无法及时赶过去
{\fs14}They'll never get there in time to save him.

923
01:25:37,209 --> 01:25:40,440
他们远在银河的另一边，你看
{\fs14}They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look.

924
01:25:42,648 --> 01:25:44,741
吉诺西斯离我们不到一秒差的距离
{\fs14}Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

925
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,818
假设如果他还活着的话
{\fs14}If he's still alive.

926
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,382
你就坐视他面临死亡？
{\fs14}Are you just gonna sit here and let him die?

927
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:52,981
- 他是你朋友，你… - 他有如我的父亲！
{\fs14}- He's your friend, your mentor. - He's like my father!

928
01:25:54,193 --> 01:25:57,890
但云杜大师命我留在此地！
{\fs14}But you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.

929
01:25:57,997 --> 01:26:01,228
他命令你保护我。
{\fs14}He gave you strict orders to protect me...

930
01:26:01,334 --> 01:26:03,529
而我要前去协助欧比王
{\fs14}and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

931
01:26:04,904 --> 01:26:08,465
要保护我就跟我一起去
{\fs14}If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along.

932
01:26:10,512 --> 01:26:15,675
我不担心，R2，只是我没飞过
{\fs14}I'm not worried, R2. It's just I've never flown before.

933
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:27,928
商业协会正在备战
{\fs14}The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that.

934
01:26:28,028 --> 01:26:29,996
杜酷一定跟他们签署了条约
{\fs14}Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.

935
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:33,498
辩论终结！
{\fs14}The debate is over.

936
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,592
我们需要复制人军队
{\fs14}Now we need that clone army.

937
01:26:36,704 --> 01:26:39,339
可惜，辩论还没终结
{\fs14}Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

938
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,174
分离主义者攻击前，参议院不会同意使用复制人
{\fs14}The senate will never approve the use of clones...

939
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:43,039
分离主义者攻击前，参议院不会同意使用复制人
{\fs14}before the separatists attack.

940
01:26:43,144 --> 01:26:45,044
这是重大危机！
{\fs14}This is a crisis.

941
01:26:45,146 --> 01:26:48,274
参议院应该投票赋予议长紧急处分权
{\fs14}The senate must vote the chancellor emergency powers.

942
01:26:48,383 --> 01:26:51,443
然后他有权同意建军
{\fs14}He can then approve the creation of an army.

943
01:26:51,786 --> 01:26:53,981
但哪位参议员有这个胆子…
{\fs14}But what senator would have the courage...

944
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:56,649
敢提出这种激进的修正案？
{\fs14}to propose such a radical amendment?

945
01:26:56,758 --> 01:27:00,854
如果艾米达拉议员在就好了
{\fs14}If only Senator Amidala were here.

946
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,081
叛徒！
{\fs14}Traitor.

947
01:27:22,586 --> 01:27:25,749
不，我的朋友，你错了
{\fs14}Oh, no, my friend. This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

948
01:27:25,856 --> 01:27:27,915
他们做得太过分了，简直是疯狂
{\fs14}They have gone too far. This is madness.

949
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:30,653
我以为你是这儿的领袖，杜酷
{\fs14}I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.

950
01:27:30,761 --> 01:27:33,355
这件事与我无关
{\fs14}This had nothing to do with me, I assure you.

951
01:27:33,463 --> 01:27:36,899
我会立刻申请释放你
{\fs14}I will petition immediately to have you set free.

952
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,663
希望快一点，我有任务在身
{\fs14}Well, I hope it doesn't take too long. I have work to do.

953
01:27:40,771 --> 01:27:44,571
容我请问为何绝地武士…
{\fs14}May I ask why a Jedi knight...

954
01:27:44,674 --> 01:27:47,108
大老远来到吉诺西斯？
{\fs14}is all the way out here on Geonosis?

955
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:50,111
我追踪赏金猎人强格费特到此
{\fs14}I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.

956
01:27:50,113 --> 01:27:50,874
你认识他吗？
{\fs14}Do you know him?

957
01:27:51,982 --> 01:27:53,780
此地没有赏金猎人
{\fs14}There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of.

958
01:27:53,885 --> 01:27:55,853
吉诺西斯人不信任他们
{\fs14}The Geonosians don't trust them.

959
01:27:55,953 --> 01:27:58,820
话是没错，但他确实在这里
{\fs14}Who can blame them? But he is here, I can assure you.

960
01:27:59,957 --> 01:28:04,121
可惜我们未曾谋面，欧比王
{\fs14}It's a great pity our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

961
01:28:04,796 --> 01:28:07,264
金魁刚非常赞赏你
{\fs14}Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you.

962
01:28:11,136 --> 01:28:14,161
真希望他还活在世上
{\fs14}I wish he were still alive.

963
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,336
此刻正需要他的协助
{\fs14}I could use his help right now.

964
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,678
金魁刚不会与你为伍
{\fs14}Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

965
01:28:22,481 --> 01:28:25,382
话不要说太满，年轻绝地武士
{\fs14}Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

966
01:28:25,484 --> 01:28:28,044
他曾经是我的徒弟
{\fs14}You forget that he was once my apprentice...

967
01:28:28,153 --> 01:28:30,178
正如你是他的徒弟
{\fs14}just as you were once his.

968
01:28:31,156 --> 01:28:33,351
他知道参议院的腐败…
{\fs14}He knew all about the corruption in the senate...

969
01:28:33,459 --> 01:28:36,485
但如果他知道实情的话…，他就不会坐视不管
{\fs14}but he wouldn't have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as I have.

970
01:28:36,595 --> 01:28:39,359
- 实情？ - 是的，实情
{\fs14}- The truth? - The truth.

971
01:28:44,771 --> 01:28:47,070
你相不相信，共和国在
{\fs14}What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control...

972
01:28:47,174 --> 01:28:49,267
在西斯黑暗大帝的掌握下？
{\fs14}of the dark lord of the Sith?

973
01:28:49,376 --> 01:28:52,309
不可能，绝地武士会知道
{\fs14}No, that's not possible. The Jedi would be aware of it.

974
01:28:52,346 --> 01:28:56,678
黑暗势力蒙蔽了他们，朋友
{\fs14}The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend.

975
01:28:57,718 --> 01:29:00,278
数百位参议员已经在…
{\fs14}Hundreds of senators are now under the influence...

976
01:29:00,387 --> 01:29:04,983
黑暗大帝达斯西帝的掌控中
{\fs14}of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

977
01:29:06,093 --> 01:29:07,685
我不相信
{\fs14}I don't believe you.

978
01:29:07,795 --> 01:29:10,161
贸易联盟总督…
{\fs14}The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

979
01:29:10,264 --> 01:29:13,495
曾经跟达斯西帝结盟
{\fs14}was once in league with this Darth Sidious...

980
01:29:14,368 --> 01:29:18,202
但十年前遭黑暗大帝背叛
{\fs14}but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord.

981
01:29:18,305 --> 01:29:21,399
他向我求助并说出实情
{\fs14}He came to me for help. He told me everything.

982
01:29:22,444 --> 01:29:24,503
你一定要加入我，欧比王
{\fs14}You must join me, Obi-Wan...

983
01:29:25,714 --> 01:29:29,673
合力打倒西斯！
{\fs14}and together we will destroy the Sith!

984
01:29:31,419 --> 01:29:33,717
我绝不会加入你，杜酷
{\fs14}I will never join you, Dooku.

985
01:29:42,231 --> 01:29:45,132
或许释放你会有些困难
{\fs14}It may be difficult to secure your release.

986
01:29:52,777 --> 01:29:55,678
显然分离主义者
{\fs14}It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact...

987
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,442
跟贸易联盟已达成协定
{\fs14}wesa desa Federation du Trade.

988
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:02,850
参议员同事们
{\fs14}Senators, "dellow felagates":

989
01:30:02,954 --> 01:30:06,981
为因应共和国的燃眉之急…
{\fs14}In response to this direct threat to the Republic...

990
01:30:07,092 --> 01:30:10,789
我向本议会提案…
{\fs14}mesa propose that the senate...

991
01:30:10,929 --> 01:30:14,824
即刻将紧急处分权…
{\fs14}give immediately emergency powers...

992
01:30:14,932 --> 01:30:17,860
赋予最高议会议长
{\fs14}to the supreme chancellor.

993
01:30:20,339 --> 01:30:22,466
白卜庭！白卜庭！
{\fs14}Palpatine! Palpatine!

994
01:30:25,578 --> 01:30:28,809
肃静！保持肃静！
{\fs14}Order! We shall have order!

995
01:30:30,516 --> 01:30:33,849
我心中极为不愿意…
{\fs14}It is with great reluctance...

996
01:30:33,953 --> 01:30:36,046
同意此项授命
{\fs14}that I have agreed to this calling.

997
01:30:36,423 --> 01:30:40,382
我热爱民主，我爱共和国
{\fs14}I love democracy. I love the Republic.

998
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:43,423
各位今日赋予我的权力…
{\fs14}The power you give me...

999
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:48,058
危机消除后我会立刻放弃
{\fs14}I will lay down when this crisis has abated.

1000
01:30:52,539 --> 01:30:57,374
我接受授权后的第一项法令…
{\fs14}And as my first act with this new authority...

1001
01:30:57,477 --> 01:31:01,880
即是为共和国建立强大的军队
{\fs14}I will create a grand army of the Republic...

1002
01:31:01,982 --> 01:31:05,748
抵御日益强大的分离主义威胁
{\fs14}to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.

1003
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,985
建军已成定案
{\fs14}It is done, then.

1004
01:31:12,294 --> 01:31:15,957
我带领全数绝地武士，前往吉诺西斯帮欧比王
{\fs14}I will take whatJedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1005
01:31:16,065 --> 01:31:19,967
我将前往卡密诺星察看…
{\fs14}Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1006
01:31:21,003 --> 01:31:25,700
共和国所订制的复制人大军
{\fs14}and see this army they have created for the Republic.

1007
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,385
看到那些排气孔吗？
{\fs14}See those columns of steam straight ahead?

1008
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:48,554
应该是某种废气
{\fs14}They're exhaust vents of some type.

1009
01:31:49,432 --> 01:31:51,400
那儿可以降落
{\fs14}That'll do.

1010
01:31:59,877 --> 01:32:03,812
不管发生什么事都听我的
{\fs14}Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead.

1011
01:32:03,913 --> 01:32:06,006
我不想搅入战局
{\fs14}I'm not interested in getting into a war here.

1012
01:32:06,116 --> 01:32:07,377
身为参议员，说不定我可以…
{\fs14}As a member of the senate...

1013
01:32:07,484 --> 01:32:09,978
透过外交途径解决目前的乱局
{\fs14}maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1014
01:32:10,354 --> 01:32:12,322
不用担心
{\fs14}Don't worry.

1015
01:32:12,423 --> 01:32:14,857
我不会再跟你争辩
{\fs14}I've given up trying to argue with you.

1016
01:32:19,597 --> 01:32:22,828
笨小朋友，如果需要帮忙…
{\fs14}My obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help...

1017
01:32:22,933 --> 01:32:24,833
他们自然会开口
{\fs14}they would have asked for it.

1018
01:32:24,935 --> 01:32:28,063
你要多学学人类的行为模式
{\fs14}You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behavior.

1019
01:32:51,964 --> 01:32:56,127
身为技工，你想太多了
{\fs14}For a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking.

1020
01:32:57,236 --> 01:33:00,796
我的专长程式正是了解人类！
{\fs14}I am programmed to understand humans!

1021
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:05,309
什么意思？
{\fs14}"What does that mean?"

1022
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:08,141
意思是我是老大
{\fs14}That means I am in charge here!

1023
01:33:08,247 --> 01:33:09,874
你做什么？
{\fs14}Where are you going now?

1024
01:33:09,982 --> 01:33:13,474
外面状况不明，难道你都没有感觉吗？
{\fs14}You don't know what's out there. Have you no sense at all?

1025
01:33:13,853 --> 01:33:15,548
白痴！
{\fs14}Idiot!

1026
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,486
请等一下
{\fs14}Please wait.

1027
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:21,227
你知不知道你要去哪里？
{\fs14}Do you know where you're going?

1028
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,467
等一下
{\fs14}Wait.

1029
01:34:48,251 --> 01:34:49,980
啊，天啊…噢！
{\fs14}Oh, my goodness!

1030
01:34:50,086 --> 01:34:51,644
谁来帮我关机！
{\fs14}Shut me down!

1031
01:34:52,756 --> 01:34:54,747
机器正在制造机器
{\fs14}Machines making machines.

1032
01:34:54,858 --> 01:34:56,325
真变态
{\fs14}How perverse!

1033
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,693
慢点，R2！
{\fs14}Calm down, R2!

1034
01:34:58,795 --> 01:35:00,286
我差点儿摔下去
{\fs14}I almost fell.

1035
01:35:00,398 --> 01:35:02,366
等一下会有机会，
{\fs14}You'll get your chance...

1036
01:35:04,368 --> 01:35:06,199
我变成废铁了
{\fs14}I'm scrap.

1037
01:35:07,271 --> 01:35:09,671
恶梦一场！
{\fs14}It's a nightmare!

1038
01:35:11,442 --> 01:35:13,410
我要回家！
{\fs14}I want to go home!

1039
01:35:14,945 --> 01:35:16,845
我有做错什么事吗？
{\fs14}What did I do to deserve this?

1040
01:35:53,787 --> 01:35:56,222
不晓得可怜的R2怎么样了？
{\fs14}I wonder what happened to poor little R2.

1041
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:58,490
他老是惹麻烦
{\fs14}He's always getting himself into trouble.

1042
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,452
哦，不要！
{\fs14}Oh, no!

1043
01:36:10,871 --> 01:36:12,498
哦，不要！
{\fs14}Uh-oh.

1044
01:36:16,143 --> 01:36:18,111
我都弄糊涂了
{\fs14}I'm so confused.

1045
01:38:08,994 --> 01:38:10,859
又来了
{\fs14}Not again!

1046
01:38:11,163 --> 01:38:13,131
欧比王这次会杀了我
{\fs14}Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1047
01:38:21,274 --> 01:38:22,707
别动，绝地武士！
{\fs14}Don't move, Jedi!

1048
01:38:22,809 --> 01:38:24,299
把他们带走
{\fs14}Take him away.

1049
01:38:42,329 --> 01:38:44,160
不要怕
{\fs14}Don't be afraid.

1050
01:38:45,933 --> 01:38:47,924
我不怕死
{\fs14}I'm not afraid to die.

1051
01:38:52,773 --> 01:38:56,903
从你进到我的生命开始，我就一天天逐渐枯萎。
{\fs14}I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.

1052
01:38:58,178 --> 01:39:00,738
你说这话是什么意思？
{\fs14}What are you talking about?

1053
01:39:02,216 --> 01:39:04,275
我爱你
{\fs14}I love you.

1054
01:39:07,055 --> 01:39:10,023
你爱我？
{\fs14}You love me?

1055
01:39:13,495 --> 01:39:16,760
我以为我们决定不能相爱
{\fs14}I thought we had decided not to fall in love...

1056
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,492
因为我们会被迫活在谎言中
{\fs14}that we would be forced to live a lie...

1057
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:25,362
因为会摧毁我们的生活
{\fs14}and that it would destroy our lives.

1058
01:39:25,541 --> 01:39:28,532
反正我们的生活终归会被摧毁
{\fs14}I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway.

1059
01:39:32,682 --> 01:39:34,513
我真的
{\fs14}I truly...

1060
01:39:34,518 --> 01:39:37,952
深深的爱着你
{\fs14}deeply love you...

1061
01:39:38,155 --> 01:39:42,715
在我们死前，我要你知道
{\fs14}and before we die, I want you to know.

1062
01:40:36,881 --> 01:40:39,509
我正怀疑你是否收到我的讯息
{\fs14}I was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message.

1063
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:42,677
我按照你的吩咐转传至科罗森
{\fs14}I retransmitted it just as you had requested, Master.

1064
01:40:45,056 --> 01:40:46,921
然后决定前来救你
{\fs14}Then we decided to come and rescue you.

1065
01:40:47,892 --> 01:40:49,416
干得好
{\fs14}Good job.

1066
01:41:00,773 --> 01:41:03,799
稍安勿躁，稍安勿躁
{\fs14}Settle down. Settle down.

1067
01:41:07,813 --> 01:41:11,544
开始行刑
{\fs14}Let the executions begin.

1068
01:41:42,383 --> 01:41:45,318
我有个很坏的预感
{\fs14}I've got a bad feeling about this.

1069
01:42:09,912 --> 01:42:12,380
- 放轻松，专注心思 - 帕米怎么办？
{\fs14}- Just relax. Concentrate. - What about Padmé?

1070
01:42:12,481 --> 01:42:14,608
看来她已经脱身了
{\fs14}She seems to be on top of things.

1071
01:43:14,613 --> 01:43:16,342
她犯规！
{\fs14}She can't do that!

1072
01:43:16,448 --> 01:43:18,348
射她，或想个办法！
{\fs14}Shoot her... or something!

1073
01:44:34,195 --> 01:44:35,594
跳！
{\fs14}Jump!

1074
01:44:58,021 --> 01:45:00,782
状况不对劲了！
{\fs14}This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1075
01:45:00,891 --> 01:45:04,018
强格！把她干掉！
{\fs14}Jango! Finish her off!

1076
01:45:04,126 --> 01:45:07,357
耐心，总督，她死定了
{\fs14}Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die.

1077
01:45:36,193 --> 01:45:37,660
云杜大师…
{\fs14}Master Windu.

1078
01:45:37,762 --> 01:45:40,094
欢迎你也加入
{\fs14}How pleasant of you to join us.

1079
01:45:40,197 --> 01:45:42,222
闹剧该收场了
{\fs14}This party's over.

1080
01:45:54,813 --> 01:45:57,077
勇敢…
{\fs14}Brave...

1081
01:45:57,182 --> 01:45:59,548
但愚蠢，老朋友
{\fs14}but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1082
01:45:59,651 --> 01:46:01,516
你们人真是少得可怜
{\fs14}You're impossibly out numbered.

1083
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,952
我可不这么认为
{\fs14}I don't think so.

1084
01:46:04,056 --> 01:46:05,489
走着瞧
{\fs14}We'll see.

1085
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,823
腿不能动，我需要保养了
{\fs14}My legs aren't moving. I must need maintenance.

1086
01:47:22,571 --> 01:47:25,039
怎么这么吵？打仗！
{\fs14}What's all this noise? A battle!

1087
01:47:25,141 --> 01:47:27,336
搞错了！
{\fs14}There's been some terrible mistake!

1088
01:47:27,443 --> 01:47:30,173
我的内建程式是礼宾，不是搞破坏！
{\fs14}I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!

1089
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:56,565
去死，绝地狗杂种！
{\fs14}Die, Jedi dogs!

1090
01:48:56,668 --> 01:48:58,431
噢！我在说什么？
{\fs14}Oh! What did I say?

1091
01:49:06,512 --> 01:49:09,811
天啊，真是抱歉到了极点
{\fs14}Oh, dear. I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1092
01:49:15,488 --> 01:49:18,389
抱歉，我被绊住了，起不来
{\fs14}Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1093
01:49:31,338 --> 01:49:35,365
- 你说这叫…外交解决途径？ - 不…这叫激烈的争辩
{\fs14}- You call this a diplomatic solution?  -No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1094
01:49:40,514 --> 01:49:42,482
- Uh-oh - 收到，收到
{\fs14}- Uh-oh. - Roger, roger.

1095
01:49:59,634 --> 01:50:01,898
R2，你在这做什么？
{\fs14}R2, what are you doing here?

1096
01:50:04,106 --> 01:50:05,437
你在做什么？
{\fs14}What are you doing?

1097
01:50:05,574 --> 01:50:08,202
住手！你会扯断…
{\fs14}Stop that! You're going to strain something.

1098
01:50:08,311 --> 01:50:10,074
我的脖子！
{\fs14}My neck!

1099
01:50:12,381 --> 01:50:15,407
噢，你要带我去哪里？不要拖那么用力。
{\fs14}Now where are you taking me? This is such a drag!

1100
01:50:19,923 --> 01:50:22,448
我真是丈二金刚摸不着头绪
{\fs14}I'm quite beside myself.

1101
01:50:30,067 --> 01:50:34,398
R2，拜托小心点，我快短路了
{\fs14}R2, please be careful! You're singeing my circuits!

1102
01:50:34,838 --> 01:50:37,363
好！头有接正吗？
{\fs14}Yes, but is my head on straight?

1103
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:00,757
云杜大师…
{\fs14}Master Windu...

1104
01:51:00,865 --> 01:51:03,095
果然是一代豪侠
{\fs14}you have fought gallantly...

1105
01:51:03,268 --> 01:51:08,295
该当名留绝地圣殿
{\fs14}worthy of recognition in the archives of the Jedi order.

1106
01:51:10,274 --> 01:51:11,571
现在
{\fs14}Now...

1107
01:51:11,583 --> 01:51:13,943
你的时候到了
{\fs14}it is finished.

1108
01:51:14,046 --> 01:51:16,037
投降
{\fs14}Surrender...

1109
01:51:16,148 --> 01:51:18,844
我还可以饶你一命
{\fs14}and your lives will be spared.

1110
01:51:19,718 --> 01:51:22,846
我们不是用来交换条件的人质
{\fs14}We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku!

1111
01:51:22,955 --> 01:51:23,979
既然如此
{\fs14}Then...

1112
01:51:25,457 --> 01:51:27,516
抱歉啦，老朋友
{\fs14}I'm sorry, old friend.

1113
01:51:38,203 --> 01:51:39,636
看！
{\fs14}Look!

1114
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:54,609
生存者四周形成了个包围阵地
{\fs14}Around the survivors a perimeter create.

1115
01:52:48,144 --> 01:52:51,170
我作了个非常奇怪的梦
{\fs14}I've had the most peculiar dream!

1116
01:53:01,791 --> 01:53:03,782
万一杜酷逃走…
{\fs14}If Dooku escapes...

1117
01:53:03,893 --> 01:53:07,590
他会号召更多星系叛变
{\fs14}rally more systems to his cause he will.

1118
01:53:11,134 --> 01:53:12,965
抓好！
{\fs14}Hold on!

1119
01:53:17,508 --> 01:53:19,476
瞄准能源供应器正上方！
{\fs14}Aim right above the fuel cells!

1120
01:53:25,816 --> 01:53:28,080
非常犀利，小徒弟
{\fs14}Good call, my young Padawan.

1121
01:53:41,332 --> 01:53:43,664
绝地武士召集了一支大军
{\fs14}The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1122
01:53:43,768 --> 01:53:45,827
怎么可能
{\fs14}That doesn't seem possible.

1123
01:53:45,937 --> 01:53:48,633
这么短的时间怎么建军？
{\fs14}How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly?

1124
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:52,176
全部机器人都送上战场
{\fs14}We must send all available droids into battle.

1125
01:53:52,277 --> 01:53:54,177
敌军排山倒海而来
{\fs14}There are too many.

1126
01:53:55,146 --> 01:53:57,910
--
{\fs14}Our communications have been jammed.

1127
01:54:05,024 --> 01:54:08,025
飞行员，降落在集合区！
{\fs14}Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1128
01:54:08,127 --> 01:54:09,458
是的，长官
{\fs14}Yes, sir.

1129
01:54:16,536 --> 01:54:17,798
长官
{\fs14}Sir...

1130
01:54:17,904 --> 01:54:20,532
我有五支突袭队等待您下令，长官
{\fs14}I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir.

1131
01:54:21,541 --> 01:54:24,940
带我到前进指挥中心
{\fs14}To the forward command center take me.

1132
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:50,898
攻击联盟战舰，快！
{\fs14}Attack those Federation starships, quickly!

1133
01:55:00,381 --> 01:55:03,681
尤达大师，前线部队不断挺进
{\fs14}Master Yoda, all forward positions are advancing.

1134
01:55:03,785 --> 01:55:06,650
很好
{\fs14}Very good.

1135
01:55:07,288 --> 01:55:08,915
非常好
{\fs14}Very good.

1136
01:55:35,118 --> 01:55:38,211
战况越来越不利
{\fs14}This is not looking good at all!

1137
01:55:38,488 --> 01:55:41,753
我方战舰要退回太空中
{\fs14}We must get the starships back into space.

1138
01:55:44,794 --> 01:55:48,730
非下令撤退不可
{\fs14}We have to order a retreat.

1139
01:55:48,831 --> 01:55:51,197
我师父不会轻松放过
{\fs14}My master will never allow the Republic...

1140
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,632
共和国这次的叛变行动
{\fs14}to get away with this treachery.

1141
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:57,001
我要让战士们躲进地下墓穴
{\fs14}I'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs.

1142
01:55:57,106 --> 01:56:01,133
终极武器设计图绝不能让绝地武士发现
{\fs14}The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1143
01:56:02,579 --> 01:56:07,881
计划若曝光，我们就完了
{\fs14}If they find out what we are planning to build, we're doomed.

1144
01:56:11,121 --> 01:56:13,555
我带设计图到科罗森去
{\fs14}I will take the designs with me to Coruscant.

1145
01:56:14,491 --> 01:56:17,221
跟我师父在一起安全多了
{\fs14}They will be much safer there with my master.

1146
01:57:09,349 --> 01:57:14,050
将火力集中在最近的战舰
{\fs14}Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship.

1147
01:57:14,153 --> 01:57:16,184
是的，长官
{\fs14}Yes, sir.

1148
01:57:16,189 --> 01:57:20,047
所有象限仪调至5-1-5区
{\fs14}Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1149
01:57:58,199 --> 01:57:59,666
看那边！
{\fs14}Look over there!

1150
01:58:02,137 --> 01:58:04,537
是杜酷，把他打下来！
{\fs14}It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1151
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,540
没有飞弹了，长官
{\fs14}We're out of rockets, sir.

1152
01:58:06,642 --> 01:58:09,509
- 跟着他！ - 我们需要援兵！
{\fs14}- Follow him! - We're gonna need some help!

1153
01:58:09,611 --> 01:58:13,672
没有时间！安纳金和我可以应付
{\fs14}There isn't time! Anakin and I can handle this!

1154
01:58:36,139 --> 01:58:38,733
降落！
{\fs14}Put the ship down!

1155
01:58:38,842 --> 01:58:40,742
大敌当前怎能儿女情长！
{\fs14}Don't let your personal feelings get in the way!

1156
01:58:40,844 --> 01:58:42,607
跟紧那辆飞行机车！
{\fs14}Follow that speeder!

1157
01:58:47,685 --> 01:58:50,051
- 降下去！ - 我一个人对付不了杜酷！
{\fs14}- Lower the ship! - I can't take Dooku alone!

1158
01:58:50,154 --> 01:58:53,646
我需要你帮忙，逮到他，战争立刻就结束了！
{\fs14}I need you! If we catch him, we can end this war right now!

1159
01:58:53,757 --> 01:58:56,749
- 我们有要务在身！ - 我管不了那么多！降落！
{\fs14}- We have a job to do! - I don't care! Put the ship down!

1160
01:58:56,861 --> 01:58:59,159
你会被逐出绝地武士行列！
{\fs14}You will be expelled from the Jedi order!

1161
01:58:59,263 --> 01:59:02,294
- 我不能丢下她 - 冷静想想
{\fs14}- I can't leave her! - Come to your senses!

1162
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:05,228
如果帕米是你，她会怎么做
{\fs14}What do you think Padmé would do were she in your position?

1163
01:59:08,874 --> 01:59:10,899
她会尽她应尽的义务
{\fs14}She would do her duty.

1164
01:59:19,485 --> 01:59:21,944
机器人军队全面撤退了
{\fs14}The droid army is in full retreat.

1165
01:59:22,053 --> 01:59:25,147
很好，司令官。找艘太空船给我
{\fs14}Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship.

1166
01:59:50,150 --> 01:59:53,078
该为你今天杀害的绝地武士偿命了，杜酷
{\fs14}You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.

1167
01:59:53,187 --> 01:59:54,282
一起攻击
{\fs14}We'll take him together.

1168
01:59:54,388 --> 01:59:57,156
- 不，我现在就杀了他！ - 不，安纳金！不！
{\fs14}- I'm taking him now! - No, Anakin! No!

1169
02:00:04,332 --> 02:00:07,824
看到了吧，我的力量远超过你
{\fs14}As you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours.

1170
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:09,870
还不退下？
{\fs14}Now... back down.

1171
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:17,541
碍难照办
{\fs14}I don't think so.

1172
02:00:29,857 --> 02:00:33,088
肯诺比大师，你真叫我失望
{\fs14}Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1173
02:00:33,194 --> 02:00:36,254
枉费尤达那么推崇你
{\fs14}Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1174
02:00:38,633 --> 02:00:41,067
本事不过如此
{\fs14}Surely you can do better.

1175
02:00:50,246 --> 02:00:52,146
你还好吧？
{\fs14}Are you all right?

1176
02:00:52,248 --> 02:00:53,909
还好
{\fs14}Uh-huh.

1177
02:00:54,251 --> 02:00:56,815
赶快回前进指挥中心去
{\fs14}We'd better get back to the forward command center.

1178
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:58,512
不
{\fs14}No.

1179
02:00:58,621 --> 02:01:02,148
集结你所有的部队，我们得赶去那座停机中心
{\fs14}Gather what troops you can. We've got to get to that hangar.

1180
02:01:02,258 --> 02:01:04,226
找艘运输工具，快！
{\fs14}Get a transport. Hurry!

1181
02:01:04,327 --> 02:01:05,385
立刻照办
{\fs14}Right away.

1182
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,385
很勇敢哦，小男孩
{\fs14}Brave of you, boy.

1183
02:01:32,656 --> 02:01:34,886
但，我以为你学聪明了
{\fs14}But I would have thought you had learned your lesson.

1184
02:01:34,992 --> 02:01:36,584
我一向学得比较慢
{\fs14}I am a slow learner.

1185
02:02:36,056 --> 02:02:37,819
尤达大师
{\fs14}Master Yoda.

1186
02:02:37,925 --> 02:02:40,985
杜酷伯爵
{\fs14}Count Dooku.

1187
02:02:41,095 --> 02:02:44,462
这是你最后一次干涉我们的事
{\fs14}You have interfered with our affairs for the last time.

1188
02:03:14,762 --> 02:03:17,697
你的力量变强了，杜酷
{\fs14}Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1189
02:03:18,199 --> 02:03:21,293
我感觉到你体内的黑暗势力
{\fs14}The dark side I sense in you.

1190
02:03:21,402 --> 02:03:24,200
我比任何绝地武士都强
{\fs14}I've become more powerful than any Jedi.

1191
02:03:24,306 --> 02:03:25,933
即使是你
{\fs14}Even you.

1192
02:03:41,323 --> 02:03:44,383
你该学的还多着呢
{\fs14}Much to learn you still have.

1193
02:03:44,493 --> 02:03:47,490
显然，我们无法用…
{\fs14}It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided...

1194
02:03:47,596 --> 02:03:50,060
对原力的见解分高下
{\fs14}by our knowledge of the Force...

1195
02:03:51,101 --> 02:03:54,695
那只好用剑术决胜负了
{\fs14}but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1196
02:04:32,945 --> 02:04:36,711
技术还不错，老徒弟
{\fs14}Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1197
02:04:36,815 --> 02:04:38,578
才刚开始呢
{\fs14}This is just the beginning.

1198
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:08,238
原力与我们同在，西帝大师
{\fs14}The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1199
02:07:08,339 --> 02:07:11,308
欢迎归来，提拉诺斯大公
{\fs14}Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1200
02:07:12,177 --> 02:07:14,509
做得非常好
{\fs14}You have done well.

1201
02:07:14,613 --> 02:07:16,979
我有个好消息，大帝
{\fs14}I have good news for you, my lord.

1202
02:07:18,484 --> 02:07:21,510
- 战争已经开始了 - 完美
{\fs14}- The war has begun. - Excellent.

1203
02:07:22,121 --> 02:07:24,817
一切按照计划进行
{\fs14}Everything is going as planned.

1204
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:38,759
你相信杜酷伯爵说的话吗？他说西帝已经掌控了参议院。
{\fs14}Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the senate?

1205
02:07:38,804 --> 02:07:41,095
我总感觉不对劲
{\fs14}It doesn't feel right.

1206
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:43,609
杜酷已经加入黑暗势力
{\fs14}Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1207
02:07:43,911 --> 02:07:46,540
谎言，欺骗…
{\fs14}Lies, deceit...

1208
02:07:46,646 --> 02:07:49,746
制造猜忌是他的拿手好戏
{\fs14}creating mistrust are his ways now.

1209
02:07:49,950 --> 02:07:51,683
话虽如此…
{\fs14}Nevertheless...

1210
02:07:51,785 --> 02:07:54,211
我们最好还是多留意参议院
{\fs14}I feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate.

1211
02:07:54,321 --> 02:07:56,346
我同意
{\fs14}I agree.

1212
02:07:57,491 --> 02:07:59,356
你徒弟呢？
{\fs14}Where is your apprentice?

1213
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:03,362
护送艾米达拉议员回那卜星
{\fs14}On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home.

1214
02:08:05,166 --> 02:08:08,795
没有复制人，我们真的赢不了
{\fs14}I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory.

1215
02:08:08,903 --> 02:08:10,962
赢？
{\fs14}Victory?

1216
02:08:11,839 --> 02:08:14,239
你说赢吗？
{\fs14}Victory, you say?

1217
02:08:14,341 --> 02:08:18,038
欧比王大师，这不是胜利
{\fs14}Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1218
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:22,811
黑暗势力的裹尸布已被掀开
{\fs14}The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1219
02:08:23,151 --> 02:08:26,985
复制人大战才刚开始呢
{\fs14}Begun the Clone War has.
