其威力比第一颗死星还要强大

You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander.

31

my men are working as fast as they can.

34
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,710
那也许我能找到个新方法让他们更努力
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

35
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,000
如我所说  整个空间站将如期投入使用
I tell you this station will be operational, as planned.

36
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,090
皇帝陛下对局势的评估可没有你这么乐观

00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:20,614
your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

38
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,430
但是他所要求的是不可能的  我需要更多的人
But he asks the impossible.

39
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:24,118
I need more men.

40
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,680
那等他驾临的时候  也许你也能向他这么回奏
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

41
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,440
- 皇帝陛下会驾临此地? - 完全正确  指挥官阁下...
The emperor's coming here?

42
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:32,334
That is correct, Commander...

43
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,320
而且他肯定会对你工作缺乏进展深感不满
and he is most displeased...

44
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:37,214
with your apparent lack of progress.

I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

对你要承担的重任还没做好准备
that not ready for the burden were you.

619
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,430
对不起
I'm sorry.

620
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:10,150
记住  绝地武士的力量来自于"原力"
Remember...

621
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:10,027
a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.

622
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,940
但是要小心
But beware...

623
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,610
愤怒  恐惧  好战...
Anger, fear...

624
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:19,954
aggression...

625
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,370
这些都是黑暗的一面
the dark side are they.

626
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,830
一旦你踏上了黑暗之路...
Once you start down the dark path...

627
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,710
你就永远无法回头了
forever will it dominate your destiny.

628
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:36,303
Luke...

629
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:37,596
Luke...

630
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,720
不要...
do not...

631
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:48,310
千万不要低估皇帝的力量...
do not underestimate the powers of the emperor...

632
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,850
不然你会落得和你父亲一样的命运
or suffer your father's fate you will.

633
00:43:55,114 --> 00:43:56,240
Luke...

634
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,370
等我死去了...
when gone am I...

635
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,330
你将是最后一个绝地武士
the last of the Jedi will you be.

636
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:05,749
Luke...

637
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,920
你们家族的人对于原力都很有天份
the Force runs strong in your family.

638
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,010
把你所学的传于后世
Pass on what you have learned.

639
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:21,307
Luke...

640
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,650
那就将会有...
there is...

641
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,480
另一个...
another...

642
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:35,946
Sk...

643
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,990
天行者
Sky... walker.

644
00:45:28,624 --> 00:45:30,000
<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

645
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,680
我没法办到  R2
I can't do it, R2.

646
00:45:43,055 --> 00:45:44,849
<i>[Beep Whistle]</i>

647
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,970
我无法独自前行
I can't go on alone.

648
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,270
尤达永远与你同在
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

649
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,560
欧比・旺
Obi-Wan.

650
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,250
你为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

651
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,240
你对我说维德背叛和谋杀了我的父亲
You told me Vader...

652
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:07,621
betrayed and murdered my father.

653
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,880
你的父亲被"原力"的黑暗面所吸引
<i>Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force.</i>

654
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,920
然后他就不再是天行者安纳金  而变成了达斯・维德
<i>He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker...</i>

655
00:46:15,754 --> 00:46:17,715
<i>and became Darth Vader.</i>

656
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,550
当此事发生之时...
<i>When that happened...</i>

657
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,850
那个曾经是好人的你的父亲就被毁灭了
<i>the good man who was your father was destroyed.</i>

658
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,300
所以从某种角度来说
<i>So what I told you was true...</i>

659
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,270
我告诉你的是事实
<i>from a certain point of view.</i>

660
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,860
某种角度?
A certain point of view?

661
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,850
卢克  你将会发现  我们坚信的很多事实
<i>Luke, you're going to find...</i>

662
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:33,647
<i>that many of the truths we cling to...</i>

663
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,910
极大程度上都源于我们自己看问题的角度
<i>depend greatly on our own point of view.</i>

664
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,410
安纳金是一个好朋友
<i>Anakin was a good friend.</i>

665
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,950
当我第一次见到他时...
<i>When I first knew him...</i>

666
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,240
你父亲已经是一个伟大的飞行员...
<i>your father was already a great pilot...</i>

667
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,000
但我对于他身上的"原力"那么强大无比惊讶
<i>but I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.</i>

668
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,080
于是我亲自把他训练成为一名绝地武士
<i>I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.</i>

669
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,130
我以为我可以把他教导的如同尤达一样好
<i>I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.</i>

670
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,540
但是我错了
<i>I was wrong.</i>

671
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,390
他身上还有善良存在
There is still good in him.

672
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,270
他现在更多的是一部机器  而不是人
<i>He's more machine now than man...</i>

673
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,350
他扭曲而邪恶
<i>twisted and evil.</i>

674
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,320
我办不到  本
I can't do it, Ben.

675
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,350
你不能逃避你自己的命运
<i>You cannot escape your destiny.</i>

676
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:16,740
你一定要再次面对达斯・维德
<i>You must face Darth Vader again.</i>

677
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,650
我不能杀掉自己的亲生父亲
I can't kill my own father.

678
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,000
那皇帝已经赢了
<i>Then the emperor has already won.</i>

679
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,290
你是我们唯一的希望了
<i>You were our only hope.</i>

680
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,710
尤达提到了另外一个
Yoda spoke of another.

681
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,330
他提到的另外一个是你的孪生姐妹
<i>The other he spoke of is your twin sister.</i>

682
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,220
但是我没有姐妹
But I have no sister.

683
00:47:39,797 --> 00:47:42,675
<i>To protect you both from the emperor...</i>

684
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,260
为了保护你们不受皇帝的迫害
<i>you were hidden from your father when you were born.</i>

685
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,980
你们一出生  就瞒住了你父亲

686
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,560
如同我一样  皇帝也知道
<i>The emperor knew, as I did...</i>

687
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,390
如果安纳金有任何后代
<i>if Anakin were to have any offspring...</i>

688
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,070
他们将成为对他的威胁
<i>they would be a threat to him.</i>

689
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,490
这就是为什么你的姐妹要安全的匿名生活
<i>That is the reason...</i>

690
00:47:57,523 --> 00:48:01,193
<i>why your sister remains safely anonymous.</i>

691
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:02,987
Leia!

692
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,990
- 莉娅是我的姐妹 - 你的直觉很准确
Leia's my sister.

693
00:48:04,905 --> 00:48:08,325
<i>Your insight serves you well.</i>

694
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,170
把你的感情埋在心底吧  卢克
<i>Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.</i>

695
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,670
它们会为你服务
<i>They do you credit...</i>

696
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,890
但是它们也会为帝国皇帝所利用
<i>but they could be made to serve the emperor.</i>

697
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,040
看看你啊  成了将军了  啊?
Well, look at you... a general, huh?

698
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,250
肯定有人告诉他们我在塔纳战役中的杰出表现了
Someone must have told them about my little maneuver...

699
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,250
别看我啊  朋友  我只是和他们说你是个不错的飞行员而已
at the Battle of Tanaab.

700
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:47,323
Well, don't look at me, pal.

701
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:48,824
I just said you were a fair pilot.

702
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,330
我不知道他们是要找人来指挥这个疯狂攻击的
I didn't know they were looking for somebody...

703
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:52,077
to lead this crazy attack.

704
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,590
我只是很奇怪他们没有让你来做这事
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.

705
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,430
谁说他们没有  只是我没有那么疯狂而已
Who says they didn't? But I ain't crazy.

706
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,350
你可是名人啊  记得吗?
You're the respectable one, remember?

707
00:49:00,336 --> 00:49:02,922
[Chimes]

708
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,640
皇帝犯了一个重大错误  现在轮到我们攻击了
The emperor's made a critical error...

709
00:49:08,552 --> 00:49:10,387
and the time for our attack has come.

710
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,310
伯森间谍们给我提供的数据标明了...
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies...

711
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,767
pinpoint the exact location...

712
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,570
帝国新战斗基地的准确位置
of the emperor's new battle station.

713
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,490
我们同时得知死星上的...
We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star...

714
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,860
武器系统还不能正常工作
are not yet operational.

715
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,950
而整个帝国舰队散布于银河之中
With the imperial fleet...

716
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:24,610
spread throughout the galaxy...

717
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,580
徒劳的寻找我们
in a vain effort to engage us...

718
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,580
因此它现在基本上是不设防的
it is relatively unprotected.

719
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,750
而最关键的是...
But most important of all...

720
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,580
我们得知皇帝本人...
we've learned that the emperor himself...

721
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,840
现在正在亲自视察...
is personally overseeing the final stages...

722
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,430
死星建造的最后阶段
of the construction of this Death Star.

723
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,770
为了给我们提供这个消息  很多伯森人牺牲了
Many Bothans died to bring us this information.

724
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:45,923
Admiral Ackbar, please.

725
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,640
阿克巴司令  请
You can see here the Death Star...

726
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:52,900
你们这里看到的就是死星围绕恩多星的布满森林的卫星旋转

727
00:49:49,426 --> 00:49:52,638
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

728
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:58,490
尽管死星上的武器系统还不能正常工作
Although the weapon systems on this Death Star...

729
00:49:56,433 --> 00:49:57,601
are not yet operational...

730
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,120
死星本身还是有很强的防御机制
the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism.

731
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,700
它被一层能量盾保护着
It is protected by an energy shield...

732
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,450
而这个能量盾是在恩多的那颗卫星上产生的
which is generated...

733
00:50:06,694 --> 00:50:09,238
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

734
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,743
The shield must be deactivated...

735
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,840
在我们尝试任何攻击之前  护盾必须要被解除
if any attack is to be attempted.

736
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:21,250
Once the shield is down...

737
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,180
一旦护盾被解除  我们的巡洋舰将建立一道环行防线...
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

738
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,230
而战斗机将飞进这个超级建筑
while the fighters fly into the superstructure...

739
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,310
试图摧毁主反应堆
and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

740
00:50:31,218 --> 00:50:35,973
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.

741
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,200
卡尔瑞辛将军自愿指挥战斗机的攻击

742
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,610
祝好运
Good luck.

743
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,200
你会需要好运的
You're going to need it.

744
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,040
麦迪恩将军
General Madine.

745
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,000
我们偷了一艘帝国的小型飞船
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

746
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,340
把它假扮成一艘运输船  然后使用一个秘密的帝国密码...
Disguised as a cargo ship...

747
00:50:48,944 --> 00:50:51,113
and using a secret imperial code...

748
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:56,260
我们可以把一队攻击部队运到卫星上去解除护盾的发生器
a strike team will land on the moon...

749
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:55,993
and deactivate the shield generator.

750
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,630
听起来很危险
[C-3PO] Sounds dangerous.

751
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,050
我在猜他们会找谁接这个苦活
I wonder who they found to pull that off.

752
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,180
索罗将军  你的攻击部队召集完毕了吗?
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?

753
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,230
我的队伍做好准备了  但是我缺乏飞船的指挥人员
Uh, my team's ready.

754
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:07,004
I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.

755
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,480
这会很难的  我不想提起你
Arrr!

756
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:10,216
It's going to be rough, pal. I didn't wanna speak for you.

757
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:12,426
Arr!

758
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,900
- 好吧  你算一个 - 将军  算我一个
That's one.

759
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:16,639
General... count me in.

760
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,940
我也去
I'm with you, too.

761
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,590
- 怎么了? - 以后再问我
What is it?

762
00:51:25,314 --> 00:51:27,441
Ask me again sometime.

763
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,330
- 卢克 - 嗨  汉  楚伊
Luke.

764
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:31,070
Hi, Han, Chewie.

765
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,920
"振奋人心"这样的词也无法表达此情此景
<i>[Whistle]</i>

766
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,074
"Exciting" is hardly the word I would choose.

767
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:53,560
听着  我希望你乘她去
Look, I want you to take her.

768
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,240
我是说真的  乘她去
I mean it. Take her.

769
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,070
你会拥有的所需的一切
You need all the help you can get.

770
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,780
她可是舰队里面最快的飞船
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

771
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,240
好啦  老朋友
All right, old buddy.

772
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,360
我知道她对你意味着什么
I know what she means to you.

773
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,200
我会好好照顾她的  她连个划痕都不会有
I'll take good care of her.

774
00:52:04,937 --> 00:52:07,481
She won't get a scratch.

775
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,910
怎么样?
All right?

776
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,330
好吧
Right.

777
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,800
你可是向我保证了  一个划痕都不会有
I got your promise.

778
00:52:18,993 --> 00:52:20,536
Not a scratch.

779
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,090
你可以出发了吧  海盗先生?
Would you get going, you pirate?

780
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,020
祝好运
Good luck.

781
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:27,640
你也一样
You, too.

782
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,740
- 预热了吗? - 是的  她做好准备了
Got her warmed?

783
00:52:37,511 --> 00:52:38,470
She's coming up.

784
00:52:38,596 --> 00:52:40,055
Arr!

785
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:45,030
我估计帝国设计她的时候没考虑到会有伍基人会乘坐的  楚伊
Yeah, well, I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind...

786
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:44,935
when they designed her, Chewie.

787
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,300
嘿  你清醒着吗?
Hey, you awake?

788
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,880
是的  我只是有种很奇怪的感觉  好像我再也见不到她了
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling...

789
00:52:58,991 --> 00:53:02,161
like I'm not gonna see her again.

790
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,390
来吧  将军  我们开始吧
Come on, General, let's move.

791
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,860
好的  楚伊  让我们看看这堆垃圾能干什么
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do.

792
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,190
- 大家都准备好了吗? - 都好了
Ready, everybody?

793
00:53:10,169 --> 00:53:11,837
All set.

794
00:53:11,962 --> 00:53:13,339
<i>[Whistle]</i>

795
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,530
那我们又上路了
Here we go again.

796
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,450
好了  坚持住
All right, hang on.

797
00:53:43,077 --> 00:53:46,580
What is thy bidding, my master?

798
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,260
请问圣意如何?我的主人?

799
00:53:46,664 --> 00:53:51,460
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.

800
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,690
派遣舰队去恩多星系的远端

801
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,280
让他们在那里待命
There it will stay until called for.

802
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:04,710
那对于反叛军在索拉斯特星系附近大规模活动的报告怎么处理?
What of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

803
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,830
这无关紧要
It is of no concern.

804
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:11,880
很快反叛军就会被扑灭  而年轻的天行者会成为我们之中的一员
Soon the rebellion will be crushed...

805
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:11,313
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

806
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,800
你在这里的任务已经完成了  我的朋友
Your work here is finished, my friend.

807
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,600
去指挥舰上等待我的命令
Go out to the command ship and await my orders.

808
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,630
遵命  我的主人
Yes, my master.

809
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,400
要是这招不灵  我们得赶快跑路
If they don't go for this...

810
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:37,173
we're gonna have to get out of here pretty quick, Chewie.

811

Transmission commencing.

819

正在发送中
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

820
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:03,390
现在我们就会知道这密码值不值得我们付出那么大代价了

821
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,680
会有效的
It'll work. It'll work.

Arrrr?!

Where is that shuttle going?

他们有通行密码吗?
Do they have a code clearance?

833
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:45,140
是个老密码了  长官  不过是对的
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out.

834
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,230
我准备让他们通过
I was about to clear them.

835
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,956
I'm endangering the mission.

836
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,310
我不该来的  我来了会让这个任务更难完成
I shouldn't have come.

1212
01:21:45,676 --> 01:21:47,386
What's going on?

1213
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,560
我不能告诉你
I...

1214
01:21:53,017 --> 01:21:54,727
I can't tell you.

1215
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,820
那你能对卢克说?你只能对他说吗?
Could you tell Luke?

1216
01:21:56,854 --> 01:21:59,690
Is that who you could tell?

1217
01:21:59,815 --> 01:22:01,734
I...

1218
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:03,194
Ah.

1219
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,300
对不起
I'm sorry.

1220
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,730
抱着我
Hold me.

1221
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:18,910
这是投降的反叛军
This is the rebel that surrendered to us.

1222
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,950
尽管他否认  我还是相信还有更多他们的人
Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them...

1223
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,790
我请求批准对这一地区作进一步搜索
and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.

1224
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,580
他身上的武器只有这个
He was armed only with this.

1225
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,300
干的很好  指挥官阁下
Good work, Commander.

1226
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,330
你可以离开了
Leave us.

1227
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:38,130
进行搜索  把他的同伴抓来
Conduct your search...

1228
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:39,623
and bring his companions to me.

1229
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,340
遵命  大人
Yes, my lord.

1230
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:45,310
皇帝陛下一直在等你
The emperor has been expecting you.

1231
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:48,100
我知道  父亲
I know, Father.

1232
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,930
就是说  你已经接受了事实了
So, you have accepted the truth.

1233
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:56,610
我接受的事实是你曾经是天行者安纳金  父亲
I've accepted the truth...

1234
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:56,807
that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

1235
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,940
那个名字对我已经没有任何意义了
That name no longer has any meaning for me.

1236
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:03,500
那名字代表的才是真正的你  你只是忘了而已
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten.

1237
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:05,920
我知道你心中还有善意
I know there is good in you.

1238
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,660
皇帝没有从你心中全部夺走它
The emperor hasn't driven it from you fully.

1239
01:24:10,905 --> 01:24:14,283
That was why you couldn't destroy me.

1240
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,840
这就是为什么你以前没有杀害我

1241
01:24:14,366 --> 01:24:19,288
That's why you won't bring me to your emperor now.

1242
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:18,420
这就是为什么你现在不会带我去见你的皇帝

1243
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:28,720
看来你又制造了一柄新的光剑啊
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.

1244
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,320
你的技巧已经尽善尽美了
Your skills are complete.

1245
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:45,120
你确实很强大  如同皇帝预见的一样
<i>Indeed you are powerful...</i>

1246
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,314
as the emperor has foreseen.

1247
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,830
跟我来
Come with me.

1248
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:56,800
欧比・旺以前也这么想
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

1249
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:02,890
但是你不知道黑暗的力量有多强
You don't know the power of the dark side.

1250
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:05,770
我必须服从我的主人
<i>I must obey my master.</i>

1251
01:25:04,959 --> 01:25:07,670
I will not turn...

1252
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:10,270
我不会投入你的一方的  你只能被迫杀了我
and you'll be forced to kill me.

1253
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:14,230
如果这是你的命运的话
If that is your destiny.

1254
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,150
仔细感觉一下  父亲  你怎么能这么做
Search your feelings, Father.

1255
01:25:16,637 --> 01:25:18,013
You can't do this.

1256
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,910
我能感觉到你心中的矛盾  放开你心中的仇恨吧
I feel the conflict within you.

1257
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:21,058
Let go of your hate.

1258
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,580
太晚了  儿子
It is too late for me, son.

1259
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,130
皇帝陛下会向你展示"原力"的真实本质
The emperor will show you...

1260
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:33,279
the true nature of the Force.

1261
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:36,880
他现在是你的主人了
He is your master now.

1262
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,340
那我父亲就真的是死了
Then my father is truly dead.

1263
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:09,773
Urrr.

1264
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,270
控制堡的主入口...
The main entrance to the control bunker...

1265
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,390
就在那着陆平台的另一端
is on the far side of that landing platform.

1266
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,900
- 这任务不容易 - 别担心
This isn't going to be easy.

1267
01:26:32,796 --> 01:26:34,173
Hey, don't worry.

1268
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:38,150
楚伊和我去过很多比这更防卫森严的地方
Chewie and me got into a lot of places...

1269
01:26:37,134 --> 01:26:38,302
more heavily guarded than this.

1270
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:41,180
[Speaking Ewokese]

1271
01:26:41,305 --> 01:26:43,516
[Speaking Ewokese]

1272
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,130
他说什么?
[Leia] What's he saying?

1273
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:51,590
他说有一条秘密通道通向山脊的另一侧
He says there's a secret entrance...

1274
01:26:49,647 --> 01:26:51,857
on the other side of the ridge.

1275
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:14,190
司令官  我们已经就位了  所有战机都准备好了
Admiral, we're in position.

1276
01:27:12,753 --> 01:27:14,338
All fighters accounted for.

1277
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:17,030
准备倒数计时
Proceed with the countdown.

1278
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,700
所有部队准备进入攻击坐标
All groups assume attack coordinates.

1279
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,805
[Speaking Alien Language]

1280
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,040
别担心  我的朋友在下面
Don't worry. My friend's down there.

1281
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:28,710
他会按时解除护盾的
He'll have that shield down on time.

1282
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:30,688
[Speaking Alien Language]

1283
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:34,160
要不然这就是历时最短的攻击了
Or this will be the shortest offensive of all time.

1284
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:39,840
所有飞船  按我命令  准备进行超空间跳跃
All craft, prepare to jump into hyperspace on my mark.

1285
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:41,930
好  准备
All right. Stand by.

1286
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:54,003
[Whistle]

1287
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,719
[Speaking Ewokese]

1288
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:03,660
后门  是吧?这主意不错
Back door, huh? Good idea.

1289
01:28:04,305 --> 01:28:06,515
[Speaking Ewokese]

1290
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:10,186
[Speaking Ewokese]

1291
01:28:10,269 --> 01:28:12,146
It's only a few guards.

1292
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:15,000
只有几个警卫  应该不怎么困难
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

1293
01:28:15,274 --> 01:28:18,110
[Speaking Ewokese]

[Speaking Ewokese]

1295
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:23,020
只要一个人发现就足以拉响警报了
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

1296
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:25,640
那我们就无声无息的把他们干掉
Then we'll do it real quiet like.

1297
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:28,260
- 哦  天啊  莉娅公主 - 安静
Oh, my! Princess Leia!

1298
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,400
我恐怕我们的毛绒同伴...
I'm afraid our furry companion...

1299
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:33,650
已经跑过去做什么冒失的举动了
has gone and done something rather rash.

1300
01:28:33,918 --> 01:28:35,753
Rrrrooohh.

1301
01:28:35,836 --> 01:28:37,713
Oh, no.

1302
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,120
突然袭击没戏了
[Han] There goes our surprise attack.

1303
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,660
看  那里!抓住他!
[Starts Engine]

1304
01:28:48,557 --> 01:28:50,809
Look, over there! Stop him!

1305
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,600
这小毛球干的还真不错  就剩一个了
Not bad for a little furball.

1306
01:29:03,614 --> 01:29:05,115
There's only one left.

1307
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:08,190
你待在这里  我们会解决掉他的
You stay here.

1308
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,327
We'll take care of this.

1309
01:29:08,452 --> 01:29:09,912
I have decided...

1310
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,520
我决定我们应该待在此处
that we shall stay here.

1311
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:14,583
Whoo-whoo!

1312
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:15,501
Yahoo!

1313
01:29:19,964 --> 01:29:21,423
Whoo whoo!

1314
01:29:24,093 --> 01:29:26,595
Wa ha ha ha!

1315
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:37,815
Wa ha ha ha!

1316
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:43,390
嘿!
Hey!

1317
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,829
Yoooaww!

1318
01:29:53,163 --> 01:29:54,415
Ooohm.

1319
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:50,330
欢迎啊  年轻的天行者
Welcome, young Skywalker.

1320
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:52,790
我等你多时了
I have been expecting you.

1321
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,800
你再也不需要那些了
You'll no longer need those.

1322
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:03,140
警卫  你可以退下了
Guards, leave us.

1323
01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:14,020
我正期待着完成你的训练呢
I'm looking forward to completing your training.

1324
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:19,230
到时  你就会承认我是你的主人了
In time, you will call me master.

1325
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:21,830
那你就大错特错了
You're gravely mistaken.

1326
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,080
你无法像对我父亲一样转变我
You won't convert me as you did my father.

1327
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,710
哦  不  年轻的绝地武士
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

1328
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:34,920
你会发现错的是你...
<i>You will find that it is you who are mistaken...</i>

1329
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:40,470
而且你对于很多事情理解都是错的
about a great many things.

1330
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:43,810
这是他的光剑
[Vader] His lightsaber.

1331
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:47,600
啊  没错  绝地武士的武器
Ah, yes. A Jedis weapon.

1332
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,810
和你父亲的差不多
Much like your father's.

1333
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:55,740
但是你要知道你父亲再也无法脱离黑暗一方了
By now you must know...

1334
01:31:52,157 --> 01:31:53,909
your father can never be turned...

1335
01:31:53,993 --> 01:31:56,036
from the dark side.

1336
01:31:55,870 --> 01:31:58,700
而你也将如此
So will it be with you.

1337
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,870
你错了
You're wrong.

1338
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,080
很快我就会死去...而你会和我一起死去
Soon I'll be dead, and you with me.

1339
01:32:04,336 --> 01:32:06,297
Ha ha ha ha!

1340
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,840
也许你说的是你们反叛舰队马上要进行的攻击吧
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack...

1341
01:32:09,884 --> 01:32:11,969
of your rebel fleet.

1342
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,090
没错吧
Yes.

1343
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:19,340
我向你保证我们待在这里是非常安全的
I assure you...

1344
01:32:16,432 --> 01:32:20,519
we are quite safe from your friends here.

1345
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,390
你的过于自信正是你的弱点
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

1346
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,640
你对于你朋友的迷信则是你的弱点
Your faith in your friends is yours.

1347
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:32,770
反抗是无意义的  儿子
[Vader] It is pointless to resist, my son.

1348
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:42,280
已经发生的一切都是按我的剧本在进行
Everything that has transpired...

1349
01:32:38,746 --> 01:32:42,166
has done so according to my design.

1350
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:45,620
你在守护卫星上的那群朋友
Your friends up there on the sanctuary moon...

1351
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:50,080
正在迈进一个陷阱  你们的反抗舰队也一样
are walking into a trap, as is your rebel fleet.

1352
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:54,500
是我允许同盟军...
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

1353
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,050
知道护盾发生器的地点的
to know the location of the shield generator.

1354
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:02,230
你们那一小群可怜的家伙对它是无法撼动分毫的
It is quite safe from your pitiful little band.

1355
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:06,600
一群我最好的部队正在等待着他们呢
An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.

1356
01:33:06,857 --> 01:33:08,567
Oh...

1357
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:12,860
恐怕偏导护盾...
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

到你朋友来的时候还会工作的很正常呢!

舰队马上就要来了
The fleet will be here any moment.

冲啊  上啊!

[Speaking Alien Language]

1385
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:40,990
我们马上就能知道这个护盾究竟是不是解除了
We've got to get a reading...

1386
01:34:39,783 --> 01:34:41,118
on that shield.

1387
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:45,330
如果他们不知道我们会来
[Speaking Alien Language]

1388
01:34:42,786 --> 01:34:44,705
How could they be jamming us...

1389
01:34:44,788 --> 01:34:46,123
if they don't know...

1390
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,950
他们怎么会干扰我们的通信
if we're coming.

1391
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:51,590
放弃进攻  护盾仍然在工作
Break off the attack!

1392

我没有收到任何探测数据  你肯定吗?
I get no reading. You sure?

1394
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:56,080
拉起!所有飞船拉起!
Pull up! All craft pull up!

1395

进行规避动作  绿色编队  紧密控制MV-7地区
Take evasive action.

司令官  47区发现敌舰
Admiral, we have enemy ships in Sector 47.

1398
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,770
这是个陷阱
It's a trap!

战机逼近
Fighters coming in!

他们数量太多了
There's too many of them!

1401
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,830
加速至战斗速度  吸引他们的火力  不要让他们射击巡洋舰
Accelerate to attack speed.

1402
01:35:26,163 --> 01:35:27,957
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,990
金色长机  遵命
Copy, Gold Leader.

See for yourself.

从这里  你将见证到同盟军的最后毁灭
From here, you will witness...

1407
01:35:41,804 --> 01:35:44,807
the final destruction of the Alliance...

01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:48,600
和你们那无关痛痒的反叛的最后终结
and the end of your insignificant rebellion.

1409

你想要这个
You want this...

1410

对吧?
don't you?

1411
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:03,490
你胸中的仇恨正越来越强
The hate is swelling in you now.

1412
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:06,450
拿起你的绝地武器吧
Take your Jedi weapon.

1413

用他来杀我
Use it.

1414

我现在手无存铁
I am unarmed.

1415

用他把我击倒吧
Strike me down with it.

1416
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:15,090
屈服于你的愤怒
Give in to your anger.

1417
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:21,260
每一刻  你都将逐渐变成我的仆人
With each passing moment...

1418
01:36:18,507 --> 01:36:22,428
you make yourself more my servant.

1419
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,900
这是无可避免的
No.

1420
01:36:27,975 --> 01:36:30,436
It is unavoidable.

1421
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:33,110
这是你命中注定的
It is your destiny.

好啦  快走啊
All right, move it!

1426
01:37:03,844 --> 01:37:06,305
Keep moving. Come on.

1427
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:11,690
喂  我说  那边的
Hello!

1428
01:37:10,017 --> 01:37:11,810
I say, over there!

01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:14,810
你们在找我吗?
Were you looking for me?

1430
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,200
把那两个家伙抓过来
Grr!

1431
01:37:16,273 --> 01:37:18,317
Bring those two down here.

1432
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:30,130
他们过来了  R2  你肯定这是个好主意吗?
Well, they're on their way.

1433
01:37:27,284 --> 01:37:30,079
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

1434
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:31,580
站住
Freeze!

1435
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,830
别动
Don't move!

1436
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:34,880
我们投降
We surrender.

1437
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:37,253
- Aiyee! - Haa!

1442
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,930
- 我们需要R2 - 终端在这里
Here's the terminal.

1443
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:47,060
R2  你在哪里?
R2, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.

1444
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,150
到地堡这里来  我们需要你

1445
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,730
走?你什么意思?
What do you mean, you're going?

1446
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:56,070
去哪里啊  R2?
<i>[Bleep Boop]</i>

1447
01:39:54,557 --> 01:39:56,225
Going where, R2?

1448
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:00,410
等等  R2  这可不是逞英雄的时候
No, wait!

1449
01:39:57,768 --> 01:40:00,229
This is no time for heroics!

1450
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,200
回来!
Come back!

1451

Watch yourself, Wedge. Three from above.

- 红色三号  红色二号  靠近我 - 明白
Red 3, Red 2, pull in.

Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

1455
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:40,120
向左急转  我对付长机
Cut to the left. I'll take the leader.

1456
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,210
他们正飞向医疗舰
They're heading for the medical frigate.

1457
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:56,420
气压稳定
Pressure steady.

1458
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:08,890
只有战斗机在攻击  灭星者在等什么?
Only the fighters are attacking.

1459
01:41:07,171 --> 01:41:08,964
I wonder what those Stardestroyers are waiting for.

1460
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:15,240
长官!我们已经就位  准备攻击!
We're in attack position, sir.

1461
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:18,530
- 就地等待 - 我们不进攻吗  长官?
Hold here.

1462
01:41:16,514 --> 01:41:17,890
We're not going to attack?

1463
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:21,950
我的命令是陛下亲自下的  他有特殊计划
I have my orders from the emperor himself.

1464
01:41:20,017 --> 01:41:21,852
He has something special planned for them.

1465
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,990
我们只要防止他们逃跑即可
We only need to keep them from escaping.

1466
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:29,790
如你所见  年轻的学徒
As you can see, my young apprentice...

你的朋友们已经失败了
your friends have failed.

1468
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:36,340
现在看看这个...
Now witness the firepower...

1469
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:41,810
全副武装的战斗基地的威力吧
of this fully armed and operational battle station.

1470
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:45,520
指挥官  自由射击!
Fire at will, Commander.

1471
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:54,240
射击
Fire.

1472
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:03,410
这是从死星射出来的
Oh!

1473
01:42:00,975 --> 01:42:04,395
That blast came from the Death Star.

1474
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:06,700
那家伙可以工作
That thing's operational!

1475
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,660
大本营一号  这是金色长机
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

1476
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,870
我们也见到了  所有部队准备撤退
All craft prepare to retreat.

1477
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:13,210
可是你再不会得到这么好的机会了  司令官
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

1478
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:16,090
我们别无选择  卡尔瑞辛将军
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

1479
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:19,510
我们的巡洋舰顶不住那个级别的攻击
Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.

1480
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,340
汉会解除那个护盾的  我们要给他更多的时间
Han will have that shield down.

1481
01:42:21,495 --> 01:42:23,455
We've got to give him more time.

1482
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,570
我们来啦
We're coming!

1483
01:42:47,146 --> 01:42:48,397
Aah!

1484
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:50,790
快啊
Come on, come on!

1485

1490
01:43:11,295 --> 01:43:13,255
<i>Eeooow...</i>

1491
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,780
好吧  我猜我能找到开门的线路
Well, I suppose I could hot-wire this thing.

1492
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:18,370
我掩护你

是的  靠近  能有多近就有多近
Yes, I said closer.

1496
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:05,240
在极近距离对灭星者进行攻击
Move as close as you can and engage those Stardestroyers...

1497
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:08,790
但是在那种距离我们顶不住灭星者多久的攻击
at point-blank range!

1498
01:44:05,474 --> 01:44:07,309
At that close range, we won't last long...

她要爆炸啦!
She's going to blow!

1503

我被击中了!
I'm hit!

1504
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:31,180
你的舰队已经失败了
Your fleet is lost...

1505
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,360
而你在恩多卫星上的朋友们也不可能存活
and your friends on the Endor moon...

1506
01:44:34,003 --> 01:44:36,589
will not survive.

1507
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:40,070
无路可逃啦
There is no escape...

1508
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:42,830
年轻的学徒
my young apprentice.

1509
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,500
同盟即将毁灭
The Alliance will die...

1510
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:52,220
你的朋友也将死去
as will your friends.

1511

很好
Good.

我能感觉到你的愤怒
I can feel your anger.

1513
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:06,640
我现在没有防护  拿起你的武器吧
I am defenseless.

1514
01:45:04,658 --> 01:45:06,744
Take your weapon.

1515
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:09,890
用你的仇恨将我击倒...
Strike me down with all of your hatred...

1516
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:14,520
然后你就将彻底进入黑暗一方
and your journey towards the dark side...

1517
01:45:13,209 --> 01:45:14,627
will be complete!

1518
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:27,223

Ah... eeyaheeyah... eeyaheeyah!

01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,860
- 看! - 把他从那弄走!
Look!

1522
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:56,752
Get him off of there!

1523
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,422
Aaah!

你还好吗?
Princess Leia, are you all right?

1531
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:03,000
- 让我看看 - 还不错
Let's see.

1532

- 站住! - 哦  亲爱的
It's not bad.

别动
- Freeze! - Oh, dear.

Don't move!

欧比・旺把你教的不错啊
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

1549
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:17,280
我不会和你作战了  父亲
I will not fight you, Father.

1550
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:34,170
放下你的武器是很不明智的
You are unwise to lower your defenses.

1551
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:01,530
你的思想背叛了你  父亲
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

我能感觉到你内心的善良  矛盾

You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before.

我不信现在你就行
I don't believe you'll destroy me now.

你太低估黑暗的力量了
You underestimate...

1558
01:50:15,469 --> 01:50:18,556
the power of the dark side.

1559
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:20,420
如果你不作战
If you will not fight...

<i>The rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods.</i>

1570
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:12,650
我们需要增援以便继续追击
<i>We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.</i>

1571

派三个班过去帮忙

- 打开后门 - 遵命  长官

我不会和你作战的
[Luke] I will not fight you.

1576
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:03,450
来黑暗这方吧
Give yourself to the dark side.

1577
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:09,090
只有这样才能救你的朋友
It is the only way you can save your friends.

1578
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:11,840
就是这样
Yes.

1579
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:13,920
你的思想背叛了你
Your thoughts betray you.

1580
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:16,590
你对他们的感情是如此之深....
Your feelings for them are strong...

1581
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:18,590
尤其是对

你的姐妹
sister.

1583
01:52:23,690 --> 01:52:28,020
你有一个孪生姐妹
So...

1584
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:27,685
you have a twin sister.

1585
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:31,850
你的感觉也正在背叛她
Your feelings have now betrayed her, too.

1586
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:36,070
欧比・旺很聪明  把她偷偷藏起来
Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.

1587
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:40,580
不过现在他是彻底失败了
Now his failure is complete.

1588
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:45,860
如果你不愿意投入黑暗一方
If you will not turn to the dark side...

1589
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,790
那也许她会
then perhaps she will.

1590
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,830
不可能!
Never!

你的恨意让你强大!
Your hate has made you powerful.

1594
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:50,400
现在  走完你注定要走的路...
Now...

1595
01:53:46,931 --> 01:53:50,476

1596
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:54,610
取代你父亲的位置  在我身边为我服务
and take your father's place at my side.

1597
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:11,000
决不!
Never.

1598
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:16,210
我决不会投入黑暗一方
I'll never turn to the dark side.

1599
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:22,020
你失败了  皇帝陛下
You've failed, Your Highness.

1600
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:24,100
我是一个绝地武士...
I am a Jedi...

1601
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:26,270
如同我面前的父亲一样
like my father before me.

1602
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:37,320
好吧  绝地武士
So be it...

1603
01:54:35,437 --> 01:54:37,439
Jedi.

1604
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:39,410
跑啊!
Move!

1605
01:54:38,983 --> 01:54:40,109
Move!

1606
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:55,920
护盾已经解除了  对死星主反应堆发动攻击
The shield is down!

1607
01:54:53,664 --> 01:54:56,000
Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor!

1608
01:54:56,050 --> 01:54:59,800
我们马上就去  红色编队  金色编队  所有战机跟我来
We're on our way.

1609
01:54:57,668 --> 01:55:00,045
Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

1610
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:01,840
我告诉过你他们一定能办到
I told you they'd do it!

1611
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:11,610
如果你不愿投入我们...
If you will not be turned...

1612
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:15,070
你就会被消灭
you will be destroyed.

1613
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:23,830
年轻的傻瓜
Young fool.

1614
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:27,620
现在  到了这最后时刻
Only now, at the end...

1615
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:29,630
你明白了吗
do you understand.

1616
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:48,610
你那点微末功夫根本无法和黑暗的力量相提并论
Your feeble skills are no match...

1617
01:55:46,425 --> 01:55:48,677
for the power of the dark side.

1618
01:55:52,450 --> 01:55:56,280
你太没眼光了  你会为此付出代价的
Aaah!

1619
01:55:52,515 --> 01:55:56,393
You have paid the price for your lack of vision.

1620
01:55:56,477 --> 01:55:57,770
Aaah!

1621
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:03,700
父亲  救我!
Father, please!

1622
01:56:03,776 --> 01:56:05,569
Ow! Aaah!

1623
01:56:08,531 --> 01:56:10,533
Help me!

1624
01:56:17,414 --> 01:56:18,874
Aaah!

1625
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:21,170
现在  年轻的天行者...
Now, young Skywalker...

1626
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,140
你将死去
you will die.

1627
01:56:33,973 --> 01:56:36,100
Aahh!

1628
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,232
Ow! Aaah!

1629
01:56:57,204 --> 01:56:59,123
Aaah!

1630
01:57:06,797 --> 01:57:09,842
Aaaahhhhh!

[Labored Breathing]

1632
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:49,360
我要上了
I'm going in.

1633
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:53,730
这什么都没有
Here goes nothing.

1634
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:04,700
去最强的火力区  能源发生器一定在那里
Now lock onto the strongest power source.

1635
01:58:02,686 --> 01:58:04,813
It should be the power generator.

1636
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:10,370
保持编队  小心驾驶  我们可能很快就没有足够空间了
Form up. Stay alert.

1637
01:58:08,692 --> 01:58:10,486
We could run out of space real fast.

1638
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:28,060
分开  飞回到表面去
Split up and head back to the surface.

1639
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:31,360
看看你能不能吸引一些敌机跟住你
See if you can get a few of those TI E fighters to follow you.

1640
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:32,440
遵命  金色长机
Copy, Gold Leader.

1641
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:44,330
太近了
That was too close.

1642
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:50,500
我们得给那些战机更多时间
We've got to give those fighters more time.

1643
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:53,670
击中火力射击超级灭星者
Concentrate all fire on that Super Stardestroyer.

1644
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:01,930
长官  舰桥的偏导护盾已经失效了
Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shields.

1645
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:05,060
增加前方火力  我不希望任何东西穿过来
Intensify the forward batteries.

1646
01:59:03,581 --> 01:59:05,124
I don't want anything to get through!

01:59:07,570 --> 01:59:09,310
增加前方火力!
Intensify forward firepower!

1648
01:59:09,503 --> 01:59:11,088
Aaah!

1649
01:59:11,150 --> 01:59:12,350
太晚了!
