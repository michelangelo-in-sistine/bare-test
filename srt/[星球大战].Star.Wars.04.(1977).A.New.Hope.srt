1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:20,000



3
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:30,000



4
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:27,950
很久很久以前，在一个遥远的银河中…

5
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:40,198
星球大战

6
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:47,445
第四部 新希望

7
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:51,511
在这个时候，内战连连

8
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:55,787
反抗军的飞船从秘密基地袭击邪恶的帝国军

9
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,977
并赢取了初次胜利

10
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:01,835
在这次战争中

11
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:08,508
反抗军的间谍窃取了帝国的终极武器“死星”的设计图

12
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:11,480
死星是一座武装太空站

13
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:14,035
其威力足以摧毁一个星球

14
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:21,126
在邪恶的帝国军追捕下

15
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:27,069
莉娅公主急于将偷得设计图护送回航

16
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:33,222
用它来解救她的人民，并且使整个银河系获得新生…

17
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:49,458
你听到了吗？
Did you hear that?

18
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:51,217
他们毁坏了主反应堆
They shut down the main reactor.

19
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,969
我们肯定完蛋了
We'll be destroyed for sure.

20
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:54,010
太疯狂了
This is madness.

21
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,306
我们死定了
We're doomed.

22
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:12,607
公主这次无法脱身了
There'll be no escape for the princess this time.

23
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:14,864
那是什么？
What's that?

24
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,717
R2-D2，你在哪里？
R2-D2, where are you?

25
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:16,908
总算找到你了
At last!

26
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:18,782
你到哪里去了？
Where have you been?

27
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,078
他们就要从这里过来了
They're heading in this direction.

28
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,000
我们该怎么办？
What are we going to do?

29
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,870
我们会被送到开索的乱坟场…
We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel...

30
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,462
被捣成碎片的！
smashed into who knows what!

31
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:29,544
等等，你要去哪里？
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

32
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:44,351
死星的设计图不在主计算机中
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.

33
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:47,105
你截取的那些信息到哪里去了？
Where are those transmissions you intercepted?

34
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:50,023
你把那些设计图怎么了？
What have you done with those plans?

35
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,991
我们没有截取任何的信息
We intercepted no transmissions.

36
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:54,861
这是一艘领事飞船
This is a consular ship.

37
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:57,070
我们在执行外交任务
We're on a diplomatic mission.

38
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:59,411
如果这是领事飞船…
If this is a consular ship...

39
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,747
那么大使在哪里？
where is the ambassador?

40
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:08,624
指挥官，掘地三尺也要把那些设计图找出来
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans...

41
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,760
把乘客带来！要活的！
and bring me the passengers! I want them alive!

42
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,859
那里有一个，设定为击晕模式
There's one. Set for stun.

43
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,192
她没事的
She'll be all right.

44
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,200
报告维达勋爵，我们抓到了一个囚犯
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

45
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,448
嘿，这里是不允许进入的，是禁区
Hey! You're not permitted in there. It's restricted.

46
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:41,333
你会失灵的
You'll be deactivated for sure.

47
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,665
不要嫌我嗦…
Don't you call me a mindless philosopher...

48
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:45,911
你不该去那里
you overweight glob of grease!

49
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:47,672
在别人看到你之前快出来吧
Now come out before somebody sees you.

50
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,920
秘密使命？什么计划？
Secret mission? What plans?

51
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:53,334
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

52
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:54,931
我不要进去
I'm not getting in there.

53
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,558
我一定会后悔的
I'm going to regret this.

54
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,403
又来了一个
There goes another one.

55
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,652
别开火，没有生命体
Hold your fire. There's no life forms.

56
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:12,442
里面一定是些铁家伙
It must have short-circuited.

57
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:16,905
真奇怪，损坏从这里看不是那么严重
That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.

58
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,912
你确定这里安全吗？
Are you sure this thing is safe?

59
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,122
哦
Oh.

60
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,643
达斯・维德，只有你才会这么的胡作非为
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

61
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:44,098
帝国参议院不会对此坐视不理的
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.

62
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,348
当他们知道你攻击了外交……
When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...

63
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:46,943
不要装得这么惊讶，殿下
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

64
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,525
你可不是在干什么好事
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.

65
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:53,736
叛军的间谍向你们的飞船定向传输了若干信息
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

66
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:56,703
我想知道他们发送给你的那些计划是怎么回事
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

67
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,538
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

68
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:00,373
我是帝国参议院的成员…
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate...

69
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,911
去阿尔德兰执行一项外交任务
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

70
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:04,879
你是叛军的一员，帝国的叛徒
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.

71
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:06,582
把她带走
Take her away!

72
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,296
劫持她很危险
Holding her is dangerous.

73
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:13,971
如果事情传出去…
If word of this gets out...

74
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:15,889
可能在参议院中会产生对叛军的怜悯
it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.

75
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:18,590
种种迹象表明叛军间谍在和她联系
I've traced the rebel spies to her.

76
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:21,397
现在只有通过她才能找到他们的秘密基地
Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

77
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:23,894
她死也不会说什么的
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.

78
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,305
都交给我吧
Leave that to me.

79
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:27,020
发出一个求救信号…
Send a distress signal...

80
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:29,395
然后告诉参议院所有船上的人都死了
and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.

81
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,906
维德勋爵，死星的设计图…
Lord Vader, the battle station plans...

82
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:32,194
不在这艘飞船上…
are not aboard this ship...

83
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,736
而且并没有以其他方式传送走
and no transmissions were made.

84
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:36,359
刚刚一个逃生舱在战斗中被扔出飞船
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting...

85
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,038
但是没有发现里面有生命迹象
but no life forms were aboard.

86
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,916
她一定把计划藏在那个逃生舱了
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.

87
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,791
派一支部队去把它找回来，指挥官，在我个人看来
Send a detachment down to retrieve them... See to it personally, Commander.

88
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:47,412
这次不会有任何人阻止我们
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

89
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:48,628
是，长官
Yes, sir.

90
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:04,897
我们怎么这么倒霉？
How did we get into this mess?

91
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:07,695
我真不知是怎么回事
I really don't know how.

92
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,398
似乎有人安排我们去受苦一样
We seem to be made to suffer.

93
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,859
这就是我们的命运吧
It's our lot in life.

94
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:16,279
我必须休息一下不然就要散架了
I've got to rest before I fall apart.

95
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:18,370
我的关节就要冻结了
My joints are almost frozen.

96
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:26,917
这里真是个荒无人烟的地方！
What a desolate place this is!

97
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:32,921
你以为你在往哪里走？
Where do you think you're going?

98
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:34,715
我才不往那里走呢
Well, I'm not going that way.

99
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:36,426
那里太多岩石了
It's much too rocky.

100
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,385
这边的看起来好走许多
This way is much easier.

101
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,428
你怎么会觉得…
What makes you think...

102
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:42,436
那里会有住人的地方呢？
there are settlements over there?

103
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:45,483
别和我谈什么技术
Don't get technical with me.

104
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,860
什么任务？你在说什么？
What mission? What are you talking about?

105
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,320
我受够你了
I've just about had enough of you.

106
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,826
你往那里走吧
Go that way.

107
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,826
不到一天你就会失灵的…
You'll be malfunctioning within a day...

108
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,532
你这个目光短浅的废铜烂铁
you nearsighted scrap pile.

109
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,990
而且别让我发现你跟着我祈求帮助
And don't let me catch you following me begging for help...

110
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,584
因为我是绝不会帮你的
because you won't get it.

111
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,344
我不要冒险
No more adventures.

112
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:20,434
我不走那条路
I'm not going that way.

113
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:55,515
那个该死的蠢货
That malfunctioning little twerp.

114
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:57,717
这都是他的错
This is all his fault.

115
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:00,521
是他把我骗到这条路来的…
He tricked me into going this way...

116
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:02,520
但是他也不会好到哪里去
but he'll do no better.

117
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:07,901
等一下！那是什么？
Wait! What's that?

118
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,404
一个运输车
A transport.

119
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,190
我得救了
I'm saved!

120
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:13,032
在这里！
Over here!

121
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,190
嘿！
Hey!

122
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:15,987
嘿！
Hey!

123
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,620
救命！请救救我！
Help! Please help!

124
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:50,754
R2？
R2?

125
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:57,799
R2-D2，是你！是你！
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

126
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,293
逃生舱里曾经有人
Someone was in the pod.

127
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,100
是往这个方向走的
The tracks go off in this direction.

128
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,134
看，长官，是机器人
Look, sir, droids.

129
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,361
我们停下来了
We stopped.

130
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:56,154
起来！起来！
Wake up! Wake up!

131
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,084
我们死定了
We're doomed.

132
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,005
你觉得他们会把我们F了吗？
Do you think they'll melt us down?

133
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,777
别开枪！别开枪！
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

134
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,530
什么时候才能结束呀？
Will this never end?

135
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:13,867
好吧，我们走
All right, fine. Let's go.

136
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:16,116
卢克！卢克！
Luke! Luke!

137
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:22,666
卢克，告诉你叔叔，如果他买一个会翻译的机器人
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator...

138
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,538
一定要懂波西才行
be sure it speaks Bocce.

139
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:27,162
我们看起来没有太多的选择，我会告诉他的
Doesn't look like we have much of a choice, but I'll remind him.

140
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,680
好，我就要那个红色的
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

141
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:41,851
不，不是那个
No, not that one.

142
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,266
我想你是被用于行使繁文缛节的
I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.

143
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:48,778
什么意思？这是我的主要功能，先生
Protocol? Why, it's my primary function, sir.

144
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,360
我对于所有的风俗习惯都了如指掌…
I am well-versed in all the customs...

145
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,115
我不需要你这样的机器人
I have no need for a protocol droid.

146
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:54,785
你当然不需要了，先生
Of course you haven't, sir.

147
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:56,109
在这样的环境中是不需要的
Not in an environment such as this.

148
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,526
这就是为什么我已计划…
That is why I have been programmed...

149
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:59,787
我只需要一个机器人能够懂得…
What I really need is a droid who understands...

150
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,790
水蒸气蒸发器的二进制语言
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

151
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:05,204
蒸发器？先生，我的首要任务是操纵二进制货物起重机…
Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters...

152
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:06,587
在各个方面都和你的蒸发器很类似
very similar to your vaporators in most respects.

153
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,339
你懂波西语吗？
Can you speak Bocce?

154
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,005
我当然懂了，先生，它就像是我的第二语言一样
Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language to me...

155
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:12,417
好吧，你闭嘴吧，我要这个了
Yeah, all right. Shut up. I'll take this one.

156
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:13,835
卢克！
Luke!

157
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,509
把这两个带到仓库去，好吗？
Take these two over to the garage, will you?

158
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:19,807
在午饭前把它们洗干净
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

159
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:20,968
但是我要去托西空间站呢
But I was going into Tosche Station...

160
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,480
去拿一些电整流器
to pick up some power converters.

161
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:24,065
只要把家里的事情做完
You can waste time with your friends...

162
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:25,650
我随便你和你的朋友们怎么浪费时间
when your chores are done.

163
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,734
现在快干活吧，把它搞好
Now come on. Get to it.

164
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:29,985
好吧，来吧
All right. Come on.

165
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:34,735
还有那个红色的，过来！
And the red one. Come on.

166
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:38,445
嘿，快来，那个红色的，我们走
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

167
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:57,923
欧文叔叔！
Uncle Owen!

168
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,435
什么事？
Yeah?

169
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:02,266
这个R2的发动机坏了，看！
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

170
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:04,770
嘿，看看你们卖给我们什么烂玩意！
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

171
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,730
打扰一下，先生…
Excuse me, sir...

172
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:12,314
那个R2的情况非常好，绝对是笔好买卖
but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain.

173
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,739
欧文叔叔，那个怎么样？
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

174
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:16,198
那个蓝色的如何？
What about that blue one?

175
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,654
我们要那个了
We'll take that one.

176
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,988
把它拿走
Take this away.

177
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,453
你一定会对他满意的，先生
You'll be very pleased with that one, sir.

178
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,376
他的状态绝对是一流的
He really is in first-class condition.

179
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:24,701
我以前和他共事过
I've worked with him before.

180
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:25,668
他来了
Here he comes.

181
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,885
好吧，我们走
O.K. Let's go.

182
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:32,838
现在，你可不要忘了这事
Now, don't you forget this.

183
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,715
为什么我要为你卖命
Why I should stick my neck out for you...

184
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:36,758
这可不是我该做的
is quite beyond my capacity.

185
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:44,356
感谢造物主！
Thank the maker!

186
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,476
油浴实在是太舒服了
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

187
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:50,229
沙土的侵蚀让我的情况很不好
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination...

188
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:51,396
我都快不能动了
I can barely move.

189
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:52,564
太不公平了
It just isn't fair.

190
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,242
诶，毕格斯是对的
Oh, Biggs is right.

191
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,657
我永远都不能离开这里
I'm never gonna get out of here.

192
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:58,745
我可以帮上什么忙吗？
Is there anything I might do to help?

193
00:19:58,873 --> 00:20:01,281
你帮不了我，除非你能改变时间
No. Not unless you can alter time...

194
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:03,790
加快收获的速度，或者把我传送出这个乱石堆
speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock.

195
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,498
恐怕我不能，先生
I don't think so, sir.

196
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,959
我只是一个机器人
I'm only a droid...

197
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,501
对于这方面的知识不太了解
and not very knowledgeable about such things...

198
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,342
至少在这个星球上
not on this planet, anyway.

199
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:13,838
事实上，我都不知道我在哪个星球上
As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

200
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:16,345
嗯，如果宇宙中有一个明亮的中心的话
Well, if there's a bright center to the universe...

201
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:18,883
你就在离它最远的那个星球上
you're on the planet that it's farthest from.

202
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,134
我明白了，先生
I see, sir.

203
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,979
你可以叫我卢克
You can call me Luke.

204
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:23,481
我明白，卢克先生
I see, Sir Luke.

205
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:24,806
哈哈
Ha ha.

206
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,187
只要卢克就行了
Just Luke.

207
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,984
哦…我是C-3PO仿人类机器人
Oh... And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

208
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:32,486
这是我的伙伴，R2-D2
This is my counterpart... R2-D2.

209
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:33,815
你好
Hello.

210
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,326
你有很多碳化磨痕
You got a lot of carbon scoring.

211
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:39,495
看起来你们两个参与了不少行动
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

212
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,249
经过了我们所经历的一切…
With all we've been through...

213
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:43,119
有时连我自己都很惊讶，我们居然能保持这么好的状态
sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are...

214
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:44,628
和反抗军他们在一起共事
what with the rebellion and all.

215
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,628
你们认识对抗帝国的反抗军？
You know of the rebellion against the Empire?!

216
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:48,796
不然我们也不会被卖到你这里来…
That's how we came to be in your service...

217
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,301
如果你懂我的意思的话，先生
if you take my meaning, sir.

218
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:51,542
你们经历过很多战役吗？
Have you been in many battles?

219
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:52,959
一些，我想
Several, I think.

220
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:54,591
事实上，我没有太多的要说
Actually, there's not much to tell.

221
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,550
我只不过是一个翻译者…
I'm not much more than an interpreter...

222
00:20:56,684 --> 00:20:58,510
并不太善于说故事
and not very good at telling stories.

223
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:00,969
嗯，确切地说不能把故事说得有趣些
Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.

224
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:03,062
我的小朋友…
Well, my little friend...

225
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,978
有个东西塞在这里了
you got something jammed in here real good.

226
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,485
你们到过帝国战舰或是…
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

227
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:10,981
帮帮我，欧比旺・科诺比，你是我唯一的希望
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

228
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:13,155
这是什么
What's this?

229
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:15,277
快回答，他在问你问题呢
"What is what"? He asked you a question.

230
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:16,360
那是什么？
What is that?

231
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:17,871
帮帮我，欧比旺・科诺比
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

232
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:20,120
你是我唯一的希望
You're my only hope.

233
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,545
帮帮我，欧比旺・科诺比
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

234
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:27,380
你是我唯一的希望
You're my only hope.

235
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,802
他说这什么都不是，先生，只是一次故障
He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction.

236
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:34,336
旧的数据，不要理它
Old data. Pay it no mind.

237
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,845
她是谁？她可真漂亮
Who is she? She's beautiful.

238
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:40,309
我不太清楚，先生
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

239
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:42,810
我想她是我们上次一旅途中的一名乘客
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.

240
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,648
一个不重要的人，我认为
A person of some importance, I believe.

241
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:45,855
我们的船长和……
Our captain was attached...

242
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:47,148
这个录像还有其他部分吗？
Is there any more to this recording?

243
00:21:49,197 --> 00:21:50,572
表现一下自己呀，R2
Behave yourself, R2.

244
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,490
你这样会给我们惹麻烦的
You're going to get us into trouble.

245
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:55,369
没事的，你可以信任他，他现在是我们的新主人
It's all right. You can trust him. He's our new master.

246
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:01,533
他说他属于附近的一个居民…
He says that he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi...

247
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,127
名叫欧比旺・科诺比…
a resident of these parts...

248
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:05,044
而且这是给欧比旺的私人信息
and it's a private message for him.

249
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,129
坦白地说，先生，我并不知道他在说什么
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.

250
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:09,214
我们上一个主人是安德烈斯船长
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

251
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:10,801
但是经过一些事情以后…
But with all we've been through...

252
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:13,964
这个小机器人变得有些古怪了
this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

253
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:17,217
欧比旺・科诺比，我想会不会是说本・科诺比
Obi-Wan Kenobi. I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

254
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:19,972
请再说一边，先生，你知道他在说什么吗？
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?

255
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:21,978
我不认识什么欧比旺…
I don't know any Obi-Wan...

256
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:25,475
本住在沙丘之海的那一头
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

257
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,353
他是一个奇怪的隐士
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

258
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:28,897
帮帮我，欧比旺・科诺比
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

259
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,489
我在想她是谁
I wonder who she is.

260
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,646
听起来她好像有麻烦
Sounds like she's in trouble.

261
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,656
我最好从头看一边
I better play back the whole thing.

262
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,743
他说限制螺栓…
He says the restraining bolt...

263
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:40,542
把他的影像系统给短路了
has short-circuited his recording system.

264
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,454
他建议如果你能把那个螺栓拿掉…
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

265
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:45,875
他可能可以为你播放全部的影像
he might be able to play back the entire recording.

266
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,378
哦，好吧…
Oh, yeah. Well...

267
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:50,916
我想你们两个是不能从我手里逃掉的
I guess you're too small to run away on me...

268
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,251
如果我把它拿掉的话
if I take this off.

269
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:53,383
好吧…
OK...

270
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,884
好了
There you go.

271
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:00,011
等一下，她去那里了
Wait a minute. Where'd she go?

272
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,601
把她放出来，播放全部的影像！
Bring her back. Play back the entire message.

273
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:03,811
"什么影像"？
"What message"?

274
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:06,100
你刚刚放的那个
The one you've just been playing!

275
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:08,228
你这个修铁罐里面存着的
The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards.

276
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:10,438
卢克！卢克！
Luke! Luke!

277
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:11,984
好的，我马上就到，贝鲁阿姨
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

278
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:13,575
对不起…
I'm sorry, sir...

279
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:16,489
他好像受到一点扰动
but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.

280
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,246
拿着，看看你能做些什么
Here. See what you can do with him.

281
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:19,997
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

282
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:25,452
你还是考虑一下是否播放给他看吧
Just you reconsider playing that message for him.

283
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,046
我想他一点都不喜欢你
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

284
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,501
我也不喜欢你
No, I don't like you, either.

285
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:41,387
我觉得我们买来的R2机器人可能是偷来的
You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.

286
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:44,095
你怎么会这么想？
What makes you think that?

287
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,641
我在清洗他的时候无意中搞出一段录像
Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.

288
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:49,732
他说他属于一个叫欧比旺・科诺比的人
He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

289
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:54,030
我想他也许是在说本
I thought he might have meant old Ben.

290
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,571
你知道他说的是什么吗？
Do you know what he's talking about?

291
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:56,699
呃
Mm-mm.

292
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,914
我想他和本有关
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

293
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,785
那个巫师只是一个疯老头子
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

294
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:05,287
明天你把那个R2带到锚头城那里去
Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit to Anchorhead...

295
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:06,881
把他的内存清空
and have its memory erased.

296
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:08,964
这样就结束了，他现在属于我们
That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.

297
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,340
如果这个欧比旺来找他怎么办？
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?

298
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:14,503
他不会的
He won't.

299
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,012
我不认为他还活着
I don't think he exists any more.

300
00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:19,515
他和你父亲差不多一个时候去世的
He died about the same time as your father.

301
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:20,890
他认识我的父亲？
He knew my father?

302
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:22,729
我告诉你忘了这件事
I told you to forget it.

303
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:27,234
你现在需要考虑的是让这些新机器人明天开始干活
Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow.

304
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:29,271
明天一早，我希望看到他们在南边的山头上
In the morning, I want them up there on the south ridge...

305
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:31,232
操纵那些压缩机
working on those condensers.

306
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:32,397
好的
Yes, sir.

307
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:36,401
我想那些机器人工作会顺利的
I think those new droids are gonna work out fine.

308
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:40,238
事实上，我也在想我们协定
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement...

309
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,578
有关我再呆一个季节的事情
about me staying on another season?

310
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:45,870
如果这些新的机器人能够工作…
And if these new droids do work out...

311
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,915
我想今年就向学院发出申请
I want to transmit my application to the academy this year.

312
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,801
你是说在收获前的那个学期？
You mean the next semester before the harvest?

313
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:52,719
当然，这里的机器人绰绰有余
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

314
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:54,839
收获是我最需要你的时候
Harvest is when I need you the most.

315
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,966
只不过多干一个季度
It's only one season more.

316
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:58,678
今年收获应该足够…
This year we'll make enough on the harvest...

317
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,388
以后就可以雇佣更多的人手…
that I'll be able to hire more hands...

318
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:03,438
这样，明年你就可以去学院了
and then you can go to the academy next year.

319
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:05,274
你必须要理解，我这里很需要你，卢克
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

320
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:07,144
但是，这又是一整年
But it's a whole 'nother year!

321
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:08,689
只是多干一个季度
Look, it's only one more season.

322
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,897
是呀，毕格斯和谭克离开的时候，你也是这么说的
Yeah, that's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.

323
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:11,945
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

324
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,273
谁都看得出我哪都去不了
Looks like I'm going nowhere.

325
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:15,201
我去把那些机器人洗完
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

326
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:17,237
欧文，他不能一直呆在这里
Owen, he can't stay here forever.

327
00:25:17,372 --> 00:25:18,652
大多数他的朋友都离开了
Most of his friends have gone.

328
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,866
这对于他来说很重要
It means so much to him.

329
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,744
我明年会满足他的
I'll make it up to him next year.

330
00:25:22,877 --> 00:25:23,873
我保证
I promise.

331
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:27,373
卢克可不只是一个农民，欧文
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

332
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:29,500
他有太多的地方和他的父亲一样
He has too much of his father in him.

333
00:25:29,635 --> 00:25:31,674
这也正是我所担心的
That's what I'm afraid of.

334
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,852
哦！
Ooh!

335
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,391
你躲在后面干什么？
What are you doing hiding back there?

336
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:25,809
这不是我的错，先生，求你不要关掉我
It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me.

337
00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:28,778
我告诉他不要走，但是他似乎出了故障
I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

338
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:30,447
一直都在嘀咕他的任务
Kept babbling on about his mission.

339
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:32,198
哦，不
Oh, no.

340
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,954
那个R2机器人一直都有点问题
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

341
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:45,577
这些航天机器人常常无法控制
These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand.

342
00:26:45,714 --> 00:26:47,671
即使是我也常常不能理解他的逻辑
Even I can't understand their logic at times.

343
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,258
他怎么能这么愚蠢？
How could I be so stupid?

344
00:26:49,384 --> 00:26:50,547
他不在视野之内
He's nowhere in sight.

345
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,006
真该死！
Blast it!

346
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:54,545
对不起，先生，我们可以去追他吗？
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?

347
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:56,342
太危险了，到处都是沙人
It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.

348
00:26:56,475 --> 00:26:58,515
我们必须要等到早晨
We'll have to wait until morning.

349
00:26:58,644 --> 00:26:59,842
卢克！我要关闭电源了
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

350
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:02,351
好的！我马上就回来
All right! I'll be there in a few minutes.

351
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:03,940
我一定会把他找回来的
Boy, am I gonna get it.

352
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,901
那个小机器人会给我惹很多麻烦的
That little droid's going to cause me a lotta trouble.

353
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:09,353
他最擅长这个了，先生
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

354
00:27:10,448 --> 00:27:11,907
来吧
Come on.

355
00:27:19,374 --> 00:27:20,572
卢克？
Luke?

356
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:22,997
卢克！
Luke!

357
00:27:24,504 --> 00:27:25,833
卢克！
Luke!

358
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:33,842
你今天早晨看到卢克了吗？
Have you seen Luke this morning?

359
00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:35,965
他说在今天开始干活前有些事要做…
He said he had some things to do before he started today...

360
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,380
所以他要早点走
so he left early.

361
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:38,929
他把那两个新机器人也带上了？
Did he take those two new droids with him?

362
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:40,520
我想是的
I think so.

363
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:43,220
好吧，他最好在中午之前
Well, he better have those units in the south range...

364
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:45,813
把那两个机器人修好送到南边的山头去，不然那里就要多花很多钱了
repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay.

365
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:47,818
看，在扫描器上有一个机器人
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.

366
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:49,440
直向前
Dead ahead.

367
00:27:49,572 --> 00:27:52,573
可能是我们的R2机器人，按加速器！
It might be our little R2 unit. Hit the accelerator!

368
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:16,593
嘿，停下！你要去哪里？
Hey, whoa! Where do you think you're going?

369
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:19,762
卢克主人现在是你的合法拥有者
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

370
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:22,896
不要再说什么欧比旺・科努比之类的东西
We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

371
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:25,728
也不要再和我说什么你的任务
And don't talk to me of your mission, either.

372
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,105
你该感到很幸运
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you...

373
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:28,647
他没有向你射击把你打成碎片
into a million pieces right here!

374
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,856
不，没事的，但是我想我们最好还是走吧
No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go.

375
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:34,484
他现在又怎么了？
What's wrong with him now?

376
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,861
有若干生物从东南方向向我们逼近
There are several creatures approaching from the southeast.

377
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:40,828
沙人，或是更糟
Sandpeople, or worse.

378
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,833
来，我们去看一看
Come on. Let's go have a look.

379
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:44,040
来呀！
Come on!

380
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:49,417
下面有两头本莎…
Well, there are two Banthas down there...

381
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:51,508
但是没看到… 等一下
but I don't see any... Wait a second.

382
00:28:51,637 --> 00:28:53,012
是沙人，没错
They're Sandpeople, all right.

383
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:55,890
我能看到他们其中一个
I can see one of them now.

384
00:30:09,718 --> 00:30:11,343
你好啊
Hello, there.

385
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:17,014
过来，我的小朋友，不要害怕
Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid.

386
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:21,475
别担心，他没事的
Oh, don't worry. He'll be all right.

387
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:30,190
你没事了，小伙子，你今天似乎很忙呀
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

388
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:34,071
你很幸运你还是一整块
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

389
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:37,818
本？
Ben?

390
00:30:37,956 --> 00:30:39,450
本・科诺比？
Ben Kenobi?

391
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,540
伙计，我很高兴见到你
Boy, am I glad to see you.

392
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:44,669
到这里来应该多带些武器
The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.

393
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,916
告诉我，年轻的卢克…
Tell me, young Luke...

394
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:51,921
为什么来这么远的地方？
what brings you out this far?

395
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:53,714
这个小机器人
This little droid.

396
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:57,350
我想他正在寻找他以前的主人…
I think he's searching for his former master...

397
00:30:57,476 --> 00:31:00,845
我从来没有见过这么忠诚的机器人
but I've never seen such devotion in a droid before.

398
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,889
他说自己属于…
He claims to be the property...

399
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:04,601
一个叫欧比旺・科努比的人
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

400
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:05,896
他是你的亲戚吗？
Is he a relative of yours?

401
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:08,399
你知道他说的是谁吗？
Do you know who he's talking about?

402
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:10,652
欧比旺・科诺比？
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

403
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:14,400
欧比旺
Obi-Wan.

404
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:19,447
这个名字我有很久没有听到过了
Now, that's a name I've not heard in a long time.

405
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:21,990
很久很久
A long time.

406
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:24,416
我想我的叔叔认识他
I think my uncle knows him.

407
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:26,040
他说他死了
He said he was dead.

408
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:27,964
他并没有死
Oh, he's not dead.

409
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:29,206
还没有
Not yet.

410
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:30,753
你认识他？
You know him?

411
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:33,757
哦，我当然认识他，那个人就是我
Well, of course I know him. He's me.

412
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:39,717
我自从你出生前…
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

413
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:42,261
就不用欧比旺这个名字了
since, oh, before you were born.

414
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,189
看来这个机器人确实属于你
Well, then the droid does belong to you.

415
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:47,021
我不记得曾经拥有过一个机器人
I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.

416
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:50,019
非常的有趣
Very interesting.

417
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:54,409
我想我们最好到室内去
I think we better get indoors.

418
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:56,991
沙人很容易被吓跑…
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

419
00:31:57,122 --> 00:32:00,491
但是他们很快就会回来，而且数量更多
but they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers.

420
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:04,747
3PO
3PO.

421
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,802
我在哪里？我刚才一定是踏错地方了
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.

422
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,888
你能站起来吗？
Can you stand?

423
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,563
我们必须在沙人回来之前离开这里
We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.

424
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,180
我想我不行的，你走吧，卢克主人
I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke.

425
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:26,986
你不能为了我威胁到自己的安全
There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.

426
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,486
我真是不中用
I'm done for.

427
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,356
不，你不是的
No, you're not.

428
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,521
说这个算什么？
What kind of talk is that?

429
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:33,282
快点，他们就快来了
Quickly. They're on the move.

430
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,162
不，我的父亲没有打过仗
No, my father didn't fight in the wars.

431
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,035
他是香料货船的领航员
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

432
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,995
这是你叔叔告诉你的
That's what your uncle told you.

433
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,920
他不赞同你父亲的理想
He didn't hold with your father's ideals.

434
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,210
他想呆在这里…
Thought he should have stayed here...

435
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,167
与世无争
and not gotten involved.

436
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,210
你曾经参与过克隆人战争？
You fought in the Clone Wars?

437
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,215
是的，我曾是一名绝地武士…
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

438
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,628
和你的父亲一样
the same as your father.

439
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,970
我真希望能够了解他
I wish I'd known him.

440
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:03,888
他曾是银河中最好的星际飞行员…
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

441
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,567
是一名睿智的战士
and a cunning warrior.

442
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:06,606
我能理解你已经成为…
I understand you've become...

443
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,441
一名优秀的飞行员
quite a good pilot yourself.

444
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,443
他也曾是我的好朋友
And he was a good friend.

445
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,698
这提醒了我
Which reminds me...

446
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,532
有些东西要给你
I have something here for you.

447
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,543
你的父亲要我把这个给你…
Your father wanted you to have this...

448
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,044
当你长大了的时候…
when you were old enough...

449
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,210
但是你的叔叔是不会允许的
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

450
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:27,882
他害怕你跟随老欧比 旺…
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan...

451
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,965
投身那些愚蠢的理想化的正义运动…
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade...

452
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,837
就像你的父亲一样
like your father did.

453
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,762
先生，如果你暂时不需要我
Sir, if you'll not be needing me...

454
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:34,838
我先关闭一会
I'll close down for a while.

455
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,633
好，没问题
Sure. Go ahead.

456
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,845
这是什么？
What is it?

457
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:42,730
这是你父亲的光剑
It's your father's lightsaber.

458
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:46,107
这是绝地武士的武器
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

459
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:49,854
不像激光枪那样的笨重和不稳定
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

460
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:56,075
是文明时代中的一种优雅的武器
An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.

461
00:33:56,204 --> 00:33:58,410
绝地武士在旧的共和国中
For over a thousand generations...

462
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,413
是和平与公正的卫士
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

463
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:03,578
这持续了几千代人
of peace and justice in the old Republic...

464
00:34:03,712 --> 00:34:06,499
直到黑暗时代的到来…
before the dark times...

465
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:08,209
直到帝国的诞生
before the Empire.

466
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:13,168
我的父亲是怎么死的
How did my father die?

467
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:17,551
一个年轻的名叫达斯・维德的绝地武士…
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

468
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:20,805
在他投身黑暗势力之前是我的学生
who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil...

469
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:24,936
帮助帝国追捕猎杀绝地武士
helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.

470
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,149
他背叛了你的父亲，并且谋杀了他
He betrayed and murdered your father.

471
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,194
现在绝地武士几乎灭绝
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

472
00:34:33,326 --> 00:34:38,202
维德被“原力”的黑暗的一面所引诱
Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.

473
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:39,825
“原力”？
The Force?

474
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:43,327
“原力”是绝地武士力量的源泉
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

475
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:47,506
是一种力场，由所有的所有的生物所产生
It's an energy field created by all living things.

476
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,459
它包围的我们，穿透着我们…
It surrounds us, penetrates us...

477
00:34:49,593 --> 00:34:51,632
他让银河紧密地联系在一起
it binds the galaxy together.

478
00:34:58,102 --> 00:35:02,182
现在让我们看看你是怎么一回事，小朋友
Now let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend...

479
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:04,224
你从哪里来
and where you come from.

480
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:05,936
我看过部分信息…
I saw part of a message he was...

481
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:08,061
我应该已经找到了
I seem to have found it.

482
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:12,276
科诺比将军，多年前在克隆人战争中，你曾为我的父亲效力
General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.

483
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:13,737
现在，他祈求你的帮助
Now he begs you to help him...

484
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:16,075
以对付帝国
in his struggle against the Empire.

485
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:18,956
我很抱歉我无法亲自向你呈上我父亲的请求
I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person.

486
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,039
我的飞船正在遭受攻击…
But my ship has fallen under attack...

487
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,374
恐怕我把你带到阿尔德兰的计划要失败了
and I am afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

488
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:26,963
我有对于反抗军的生死存亡至关重要的信息…
I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion...

489
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,917
存在了这个R2机器人的内存里
into the memory systems of this R2 unit.

490
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:30,842
我的父亲会知道怎么复原的
My father will know how to retrieve it.

491
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:32,594
你一定要把这个机器人…
You must see this droid...

492
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:35,259
安全的送到阿尔德兰
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

493
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:37,099
这是我们最绝望的时刻
This is our most desperate hour.

494
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:41,306
帮帮我，欧比旺・科诺比，你是我唯一的希望
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

495
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:57,949
你必须要学学使用“原力”的方法
You must learn the ways of the Force...

496
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:00,287
如果你和我去阿尔德兰的话
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

497
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,824
阿尔德兰？我不去阿尔德兰
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.

498
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,420
我要回家
I've got to get home.

499
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:05,874
很晚了，我只能做这么多了
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

500
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:08,758
我需要你的帮助，卢克，她也需要你的帮助
I need your help, Luke. She needs your help.

501
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:12,004
对于这种事情来说我已经老了
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

502
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:17,433
我不该卷入的
I can't get involved.

503
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,932
我还有工作要做
I've got work to do.

504
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:22,600
不是我说喜欢帝国，我憎恨它
It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it...

505
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:25,935
但是我现在什么都做不了
but there's nothing I can do about it right now.

506
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:28,191
而且到那里有很远的一段路
It's all such a long way from here.

507
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:30,278
这是你叔叔的口气
That's your uncle talking.

508
00:36:30,406 --> 00:36:31,604
我的叔叔
My uncle.

509
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:34,232
我该怎么解释这个？
How am I ever gonna explain this?

510
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:36,112
学习使用“原力”吧，卢克
Learn about the Force, Luke.

511
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:45,328
最远我可以把你送到锚头城
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

512
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:49,461
在那里你可以换乘运输机去莫斯艾斯利，或者其他任何你想去的地方
You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

513
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:53,543
当然，你必须做你认为对的事情
You must do what you feel is right, of course.

514
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:03,353
在这个武装空间站正常工作以前
Until this battle station is fully operational...

515
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:04,893
我们都是非常脆弱的
we are vulnerable.

516
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:07,065
叛军联盟的武器非常的精良
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.

517
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:09,152
他们比你们想象的更危险
They're more dangerous than you realize.

518
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,652
对你的舰队来说是危险的，指挥官
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...

519
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:13,941
对这个武装空间站来说可算不上什么
not to this battle station.

520
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:16,782
叛军会继续获取支持…
The rebellion will continue to gain support...

521
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,573
从帝国参议院那里…
in the Imperial Senate...

522
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:21,826
我们再也不用去理会什么帝国参议院了
The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.

523
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,502
我刚刚收到的消息
I have just received word...

524
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:26,166
陛下已经永久的解除了议会
that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.

525
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:28,836
旧共和国的最后一点残余…
The last remnants of the old Republic...

526
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:30,378
终于被扫除了
have been swept away.

527
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,171
这不可能
That's impossible.

528
00:37:32,304 --> 00:37:34,546
陛下没有官僚机构怎么统治整个帝国
How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?

529
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:37,552
地方统治者有直接控制权…
The regional governors now have direct control...

530
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:39,393
所有他们管辖的区域
over their territories.

531
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,565
恐惧，将使地方星系秩序井然…
Fear will keep the local systems in line...

532
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:45,066
对于这个武装空间站的恐惧
fear of this battle station.

533
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:47,019
那么叛军怎么办？
And what of the rebellion?

534
00:37:47,153 --> 00:37:49,027
如果叛军获取了
If the rebels have obtained...

535
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,400
这个空间站全面的技术信息
a complete technical readout of this station...

536
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:52,191
很有可能性，虽然不太可能成功
it is possible, however unlikely...

537
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:54,614
他们找到这里的一个弱点然后进行利用它
that they might find a weakness and exploit it.

538
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:58,956
你所提到的这个设计图很快就将落入我们的手中
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

539
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:01,490
叛军对于这个空间站任何的攻击…
Any attack made by the rebels against this station...

540
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:02,955
都将是毫无意义的行动…
would be a useless gesture...

541
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,411
无论他们获取到什么技术信息
no matter what technical data they've obtained.

542
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:09,130
这个空间站现在是宇宙中的终极力量
This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.

543
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:11,548
我建议我们利用它
I suggest we use it.

544
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:13,089
不要过分的骄傲…
Don't be too proud...

545
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:15,428
关于你建造的这个技术玩意
of this technological terror you've constructed.

546
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:18,927
摧毁一个行星的能力
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant...

547
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:21,303
和“原力”比起来实在是不算什么
next to the power of the Force.

548
00:38:21,438 --> 00:38:24,855
不要试图用你的巫师技巧来吓唬我，维达勋爵
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

549
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:27,901
你对于那个古老的信仰的忠诚…
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion...

550
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:30,484
没能帮你召唤回丢失的磁带…
hasn't helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes...

551
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:32,572
也没有给你足够的洞察力…
or given you clairvoyance enough...

552
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,907
去发现叛军的秘密基地…
to find the rebels' hidden fortre...

553
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,711
我对你的不敬非常的不满意
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

554
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:48,246
够了！维德，放开他
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

555
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:49,961
听你的
As you wish.

556
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:54,177
这种争吵是无意义的
This bickering is pointless.

557
00:38:54,306 --> 00:38:59,052
维达勋爵在这个空间站正常运作之前…
Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress...

558
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:01,973
会向我们提供叛军基地的地址的
by the time this station is operational.

559
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,431
然后我们就去进攻叛军…
We will then crush the rebellion...

560
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:05,978
要一击致命
with one swift stroke.

561
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,776
看起来是沙人干的
It looks like the Sandpeople did this, all right.

562
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:16,619
看，这里有手杖，本莎的脚印
Look. There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

563
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:17,777
只是，我从来没有听说……
It's just, I've never heard of them...

564
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:18,863
他们会攻击这么大的家伙
hitting anything this big before.

565
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:20,030
不是他们干的
They didn't...

566
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:22,622
是有人要让我们相信沙人做的
but we are meant to think they did.

567
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:24,626
这些痕迹两边都有的
These tracks are side-by-side.

568
00:39:24,754 --> 00:39:26,913
沙人总是一列纵队
Sandpeople always ride single file...

569
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:28,922
来隐藏他们的数量
to hide their numbers.

570
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:31,339
这和卖给我们R2和3PO的爪哇人人一样
These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO.

571
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,921
而且，这些爆破点过于精确
And these blast points, too accurate...

572
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:36,385
对于沙人来说
for Sandpeople.

573
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:39,933
只有帝国的突击队能够这么精确
Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.

574
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:43,229
为什么帝国部队要屠杀爪哇人？
But why would imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?

575
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:49,937
如果他们跟踪机器人到这里…
If they traced the robots here...

576
00:39:50,072 --> 00:39:51,271
他们可能知道机器人被卖到…
they may have learned who they sold them to...

577
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:53,400
这样就把他们引到了… 家！
and that would lead them back... home!

578
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,077
等等， 卢克！
Wait, Luke!

579
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:57,160
太危险了
It's too dangerous!

580
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,474
欧文叔叔
Uncle Owen!

581
00:40:22,606 --> 00:40:25,014
贝鲁婶婶
Aunt Beru!

582
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:26,479
欧文叔叔
Uncle Owen!

583
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,995
现在，殿下…
And now, Your Highness...

584
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:18,995
让我们来谈谈有关…
we will discuss the location...

585
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:21,366
你们叛军的秘密基地的地址吧
of your hidden rebel base.

586
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:06,044
你真么都做不了的，卢克…
There's nothing you could have done, Luke...

587
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:07,715
如果你在那里的话
had you been there.

588
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:09,549
你也会被杀掉…
You'd have been killed, too...

589
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:13,259
而且这两个机器人就落入了帝国的手中
and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.

590
00:42:13,388 --> 00:42:17,054
我要和你一起去阿尔德兰
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

591
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:18,928
我在这里什么都没有了
There's nothing for me here now.

592
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:21,267
我要学习使用“原力”的方法…
I want to learn the ways of the Force...

593
00:42:21,397 --> 00:42:22,891
像我父亲一样成为一名绝地武士
and become a Jedi like my father.

594
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,958
莫斯埃斯利机场
Mos Eisley spaceport.

595
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:46,291
你找不到比这里更糟的藏污纳垢的地方了
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.

596
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:48,380
我们必须要小心
We must be cautious.

597
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:32,050
你们拥有这两个机器人多久了
How long have you had these droids?

598
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:33,377
3或4个季度
Three or four seasons.

599
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:34,794
如果你们需要可以卖给你们
They're up for sale if you want them.

600
00:43:34,932 --> 00:43:36,759
让我看看你们的证件
Let me see your identification.

601
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:40,178
你不需要看他的证件
You don't need to see his identification.

602
00:43:40,312 --> 00:43:42,638
我们不需要看他的证件
We don't need to see his identification.

603
00:43:42,773 --> 00:43:45,099
这些不是你要找的机器人
These aren't the droids you're looking for.

604
00:43:45,234 --> 00:43:48,105
这些不是我们要找的机器人
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

605
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:50,610
他能去忙自己的事情了
He can go about his business.

606
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,112
你去忙自己的事情吧
You can go about your business.

607
00:43:53,242 --> 00:43:54,191
开走
Move along.

608
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:55,525
开走
Move along.

609
00:43:55,662 --> 00:43:56,824
开走
Move along.

610
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:16,088
我不能忍受那些爪哇人人，恶心的生物
I can't abide those Jawas. Disgusting creatures!

611
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:18,680
走开，走开
Go on, go on.

612
00:44:20,229 --> 00:44:22,435
我不知道我们怎么混过那些卫兵的
I can't understand how we got by those troops.

613
00:44:22,565 --> 00:44:23,940
我以为我们死定了
I thought we were dead.

614
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:26,771
“原力”对于那些意志不坚定的人
The Force can have a strong influence...

615
00:44:26,903 --> 00:44:28,361
可以产生很强大的影响
on the weak-minded.

616
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,985
你真的认为在这里可以找到一名飞行员
Do you really think we're gonna find a pilot here...

617
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:34,660
把我们送到阿尔德兰吗？
that'll take us to Alderaan?

618
00:44:34,786 --> 00:44:37,703
多数优秀的飞行员都在这里出没…
Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here...

619
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:39,206
只是你要小心一点
only watch your step.

620
00:44:39,332 --> 00:44:41,040
这个地方可能有点危险
This place can be a little rough.

621
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:43,244
我都准备好了
I'm ready for anything.

622
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:48,299
来吧，R2
Come along, R2.

623
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,806
嘿！这玩意我们不接待！
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.

624
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:42,852
什么？
What?

625
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:44,559
你的机器人，他们必须在外面等着
Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.

626
00:45:44,692 --> 00:45:45,807
他们不让进
We don't want them here.

627
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,058
不如你们去车上等我们吧
Why don't you wait out by the speeder?

628
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:48,226
我们不想惹麻烦
We don't want any trouble.

629
00:45:48,362 --> 00:45:50,236
我同意，先生
I heartily agree with you, sir.

630
00:45:58,706 --> 00:45:59,869
呃…
Uh...

631
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,280
给我来一杯
I'll have one of those.

632
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,538
他不喜欢你
He doesn't like you.

633
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,408
对不起
I'm sorry.

634
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:43,115
我也不喜欢你
I don't like you, either.

635
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:45,044
你可要小心一点
You just watch yourself.

636
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:46,334
我们可是逃犯
We're wanted men.

637
00:46:46,465 --> 00:46:49,715
我在12个星系里被判了死刑
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

638
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:51,302
我会小心的
I'll be careful.

639
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:52,626
我要杀了你
You'll be dead!

640
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:54,637
对这个小家伙不值得这样
This little one's not worth the effort.

641
00:46:54,765 --> 00:46:57,007
来，我给你买一杯吧
Come, let me get you something.

642
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:05,856
啊！
Aah!

643
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:25,581
我没事
I'm all right.

644
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:29,129
这是楚贝卡，一架飞船的副驾驶…
Chewbacca here is first mate...

645
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:32,260
也许能载我们
on a ship that might suit us.

646
00:47:35,265 --> 00:47:38,717
我可不喜欢这样
I don't like the look of this.

647
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:57,246
汉 索罗，我是千年鹰号的船长
Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.

648
00:47:57,372 --> 00:48:00,705
楚伊告诉我你们需要搭乘去阿尔德兰星系
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.

649
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:03,123
是的，没错，如果你的飞船足够块的话
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

650
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:06,124
足够快？你从来没有听说过千年鹰号？
Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?

651
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:08,712
我应该听过吗？
Should I have?

652
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:12,045
不到12秒差就能到达开索
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.

653
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:16,179
我曾成功逃脱过帝国战舰的追捕
I've outrun imperial starships.

654
00:48:16,308 --> 00:48:18,348
提醒你一下，不是什么当地的那些破飞船
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

655
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:20,600
我说的是大的凯若里战舰
I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.

656
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,728
而且，老头子，对于你来说，足够快了
She's fast enough for you, old man.

657
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:26,483
运什么货？
What's the cargo?

658
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:29,695
只有乘客… 我自己，这个孩子…
Only passengers... myself, the boy...

659
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:31,316
还有两个机器人…
two droids...

660
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:34,367
还有，不要问任何问题
and no questions asked.

661
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,495
是什么呀？在当地遇到麻烦了？
What is it, some kind of local trouble?

662
00:48:37,622 --> 00:48:40,706
按我的话说，我们是要躲避…
Let's just say we'd like to avoid...

663
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,743
帝国军的纠缠
any imperial entanglements.

664
00:48:42,877 --> 00:48:46,626
好，这才是重头戏
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

665
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,045
而且，为了这个我要多收钱的
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

666
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,636
10,000，全部提前支付
10,000, all in advance.

667
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,587
10,000？
10,000?

668
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,473
我们都可以买自己的飞船了
We could almost buy our own ship for that!

669
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,810
但是，谁来给你们开呢？小子，你吗？
But who's gonna fly it, kid, you?

670
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,979
我想我可以，我是个不错的飞行员
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself.

671
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,480
我们不要坐在这里听他说…
We don't have to sit here and listen...

672
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,695
我现在可以付给你2，000…
We can pay you 2,000 now...

673
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,823
到阿尔德兰以后再加15，000
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

674
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,824
17,000，对吗？
Seventeen, huh?

675
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:20,738
好的，你们找到你们要的船了
O.K. You guys got yourselves a ship.

676
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,120
你们一准备好我们就出发
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.

677
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:23,331
94号停机坪
Docking Bay 94.

678
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,624
九十四
Ninety-four.

679
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:31,089
看起来似乎有人开始对你刚才的那一剑感兴趣了
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.

680
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,343
好的，我们去检查一下
All right. We'll check it out.

681
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:46,610
17，000！
17,000!

682
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:48,278
这些人一定是走投无路了
Those guys must really be desperate.

683
00:49:48,404 --> 00:49:50,444
这些钱可救了我一命
This could really save my neck.

684
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:53,194
回到船上去，做好准备
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

685
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:54,904
你必须把你的车卖了
You'll have to sell your speeder.

686
00:49:55,036 --> 00:49:58,370
没问题，我以后再也不回这里了
That's O.K. I'm never coming back to this planet again.

687
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:01,037
要离开吗，索罗？
Going somewhere, Solo?

688
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:02,911
是的，格里多
Yes, Greedo.

689
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:04,207
事实上，我刚准备去见你的老板
As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.

690
00:50:04,337 --> 00:50:06,295
告诉贾巴我现在有钱了
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

691
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,462
太晚了
It's too late.

692
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,964
你已经失去那个机会了
You should have paid him when you had the chance.

693
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:14,510
贾巴悬赏了一大笔钱要你的人头…
Jabba's put a price on your head so large...

694
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,557
银河中所有的赏金猎人都在找你
every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.

695
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:19,642
我很幸运第一个找到你
I'm lucky I found you first.

696
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,929
但是，这一次我有钱了
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

697
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:25,599
如果你把钱给我，我可以忘掉这次会面
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

698
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:28,273
钱不再我身上
I don't have it with me.

699
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:29,020
告诉贾巴…
Tell Jabba...

700
00:50:29,155 --> 00:50:31,611
贾巴看透你了
Jabba's through with you.

701
00:50:31,741 --> 00:50:34,232
对那些一看到帝国舰队就丢掉货物的走私贩
He has no time for smugglers...

702
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:36,907
贾巴懒得理他们
who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

703
00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:38,663
我有时也会失手
Even I get boarded sometimes.

704
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,830
你认为我有选择吗？
Do you think I had a choice?

705
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:45,039
你可以自己和贾巴说，他只能拿到你的船了
You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.

706
00:50:45,172 --> 00:50:47,211
除非我死了
Over my dead body.

707
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,586
好主意
That's the idea.

708
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:52,667
我等这一刻很久了
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

709
00:50:52,805 --> 00:50:54,085
我想你是的
I'll bet you have.

710
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:09,777
抱歉添乱了
Sorry about the mess.

711
00:51:18,998 --> 00:51:22,533
她对于意识探测器的抗拒非常强烈
Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.

712
00:51:22,669 --> 00:51:25,705
从她那里获取信息需要不少时间
It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her.

713
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,713
最终的检测完毕
The final checkout is completed.

714
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:29,383
所有的系统都正常运转
All systems are operational.

715
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:31,383
我们该设定什么轨道？
What course shall we set?

716
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:33,136
也许她屈服于…
Perhaps she would respond...

717
00:51:33,263 --> 00:51:35,137
另一种劝降的方式
to an alternative form of persuasion.

718
00:51:35,265 --> 00:51:36,641
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

719
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:38,641
我想现在是时候展示…
I think it is time we demonstrated...

720
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:40,477
这个空间站最大火力了
the full power of this station.

721
00:51:40,604 --> 00:51:42,099
设定轨道为阿尔德兰
Set your course for Alderaan.

722
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:43,606
好的
With pleasure.

723
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,021
把门锁起来，R2
Lock the door, R2.

724
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:50,564
检查一下街道的这边
Check this side of the street.

725
00:51:53,952 --> 00:51:57,118
这个门锁了，去下一个
The door's locked. Move on to the next.

726
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,087
与和你待在这里相比
I would much rather have gone with Master Luke...

727
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:06,672
我更愿意去和卢克主人待在一起
than stay here with you.

728
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:09,087
我不知道这些麻烦到底是怎么回事…
I don't know what all this trouble is about...

729
00:52:09,217 --> 00:52:10,877
但是我可以肯定这都是你的错
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

730
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:13,257
注意你的语言
You watch your language.

731
00:52:15,307 --> 00:52:18,427
好吧，给我
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

732
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:20,103
看看这个
Look at this.

733
00:52:20,229 --> 00:52:22,222
自从XP-38问世以后，他们就不太吃香了
Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.

734
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:23,815
这些已经够了
It'll be enough.

735
00:52:42,752 --> 00:52:45,789
索罗！出来吧，索罗！
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

736
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,883
我在这里，贾巴
Right here, Jabba.

737
00:52:50,344 --> 00:52:51,838
我一直在等你
I've been waitin' for you.

738
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,880
我总算找到你了
Have you now.

739
00:52:55,057 --> 00:52:57,133
你不会以为我想跑吧，有吗？
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

740
00:52:58,602 --> 00:53:03,015
汉，我的孩子，你太让我失望了
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

741
00:53:03,149 --> 00:53:05,188
为什么你还不还钱…
Why haven't you paid me...

742
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:08,687
为什么你杀死了可怜的格里多？
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

743
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:11,491
贾巴，如下次想找我谈话，你自己来找我
Look, Jabba, next time you want to talk to me, come see me yourself.

744
00:53:11,616 --> 00:53:12,896
不要派那些废物来
Don't send one of these twerps.

745
00:53:13,034 --> 00:53:16,699
汉，我不容许例外
Han, I can't make exceptions.

746
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,665
如果每个帮我运货的人
What if everyone who smuggled for me...

747
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:22,329
看见帝国的战舰撒腿就跑的话
dropped their cargo at the first sign...

748
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,082
那我还怎么做生意阿？
of an imperial starship?

749
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:27,087
这生意可不好做哦
It's not good business.

750
00:53:27,215 --> 00:53:30,419
贾巴，就连我也会怕阿
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.

751
00:53:31,637 --> 00:53:34,009
你以为我还有别的选择吗？
You think I had a choice?

752
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:35,883
不过我有个很好的提议
But I got a nice, easy charter.

753
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:38,305
我会把钱还你的，一分不少还有得多
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.

754
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:40,345
只是我还需要一点时间
I just need a little more time.

755
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:46,019
你是最好的我知道
Han, my boy, you're the best.

756
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:48,524
那么就20%吧…
So, for an extra 20%...

757
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:50,564
十五，贾巴，最多了
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

758
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:52,738
好吧，15%
Okay, 15%.

759
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:54,990
但如果你这次又失败的话….
But if you fail me again...

760
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,037
我一定会通缉你..
I'll put a price on your head so big...

761
00:53:58,164 --> 00:54:02,162
让你永远接近不了有人住的地方
you won't be able to go near a civilized system.

762
00:54:02,294 --> 00:54:04,915
贾巴，你是我见过最好的人类
Jabba... you're a wonderful human being.

763
00:54:06,715 --> 00:54:07,830
来吧
Come on!

764
00:54:13,722 --> 00:54:15,762
如果这飞船像他讲得那样快的话….
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting...

765
00:54:15,891 --> 00:54:17,220
我们应该可以成功
we ought to do well.

766
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:43,083
这是什么破东西啊！
What a piece of junk!

767
00:54:43,211 --> 00:54:45,418
他可是光速的5倍哦
She'll make.5 past light speed.

768
00:54:45,547 --> 00:54:47,006
他也许看起来不怎么样…
She may not look like much...

769
00:54:47,132 --> 00:54:48,757
但是在关键的时候是挺管用的
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

770
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:51,553
我自己做过很多的调整
I've made a lot of special modifications myself.

771
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:54,134
但现在时间比较紧，你们如果可以上船的话
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board...

772
00:54:54,264 --> 00:54:55,675
我们就要出发了
we'll get outta here.

773
00:55:00,312 --> 00:55:01,510
你好，先生
Hello, sir.

774
00:55:10,656 --> 00:55:12,067
往哪里？
Which way?

775
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:16,027
把弹药装上
All right, men, load your weapons.

776
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,202
把那船给我截下来，炸了它！
Stop that ship! Blast them!

777
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,217
楚伊，带我们走！
Chewie, get us out of here!

778
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:36,928
天哪，我最讨厌星际旅行了
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

779
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:57,115
看来是帝国的巡洋舰
Looks like an imperial cruiser.

780
00:55:57,247 --> 00:55:58,196
看来那些人是紧咬不放了
Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.

781
00:55:58,331 --> 00:55:59,909
别让他们追上了
Try and hold 'em off.

782
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:01,666
把防护系统调好
Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations...

783
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:02,659
我要做进入光速的准备程序
for the jump to light speed.

784
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,638
注意了，又有两架
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.

785
00:56:14,765 --> 00:56:16,508
他们想要截住我们
They're gonna try and cut us off.

786
00:56:16,642 --> 00:56:18,433
你为什么不加速阿？不是说这玩意儿很快吗！
Why don't you outrun 'em? I thought you said this thing was fast!

787
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:20,434
注意你说的话，要不你就不要跟着我们
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home.

788
00:56:20,563 --> 00:56:21,891
只要进了外太空
We'll be safe enough...

789
00:56:22,022 --> 00:56:23,932
我们就安全了
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

790
00:56:24,066 --> 00:56:25,940
我可以甩掉他们
Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.

791
00:56:30,072 --> 00:56:31,982
好戏就要开始了
Here's where the fun begins.

792
00:56:32,116 --> 00:56:33,943
你什么时候才能上光速阿？
How long before you can make the jump to light speed?

793
00:56:34,077 --> 00:56:36,746
我要先从计算机里得到我们坐标
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.

794
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:38,579
你不回开玩笑吧？他们都快追上来了！
Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining?

795
00:56:38,706 --> 00:56:41,873
在外太空航行可不像你想象得那么简单！
Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy!

796
00:56:42,002 --> 00:56:43,033
如果没有精确的计算…
Without precise calculations...

797
00:56:43,169 --> 00:56:44,249
我们可能会撞上一颗恒星
we'd fly right through a star...

798
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:45,838
或是与一颗新行星擦身而过
or bounce too close to a supernova...

799
00:56:45,964 --> 00:56:47,957
这样我们就没得玩了
and that would end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

800
00:56:48,091 --> 00:56:49,087
那闪光是什么？
What's that flashing?

801
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:50,000
我们的防护网要消失了
We're losing a deflector shield.

802
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:51,510
坐好了
Go strap yourselves in.

803
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:53,464
我们就要进入光速了
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

804
00:57:14,494 --> 00:57:16,866
我们就要进入阿尔德兰了
We've entered the Alderaan system.

805
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:18,194
塔金行政官
Governor Tarkin.

806
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:19,742
我早就应该料到了
I should have expected...

807
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,748
是你在控制维德
to find you holding Vader's leash.

808
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:23,419
我从一上船
I recognized your foul stench...

809
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:25,502
就闻到了你的臭味
when I was brought on board.

810
00:57:26,673 --> 00:57:28,880
到现在仍是这么迷人
Charming to the last.

811
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:31,630
你不知道我发现下达处决你的命令
You don't know how hard I found it...

812
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:33,719
心里有多难过
signing the order to terminate your life.

813
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:35,010
不过我很高兴
I'm surprised you had the courage...

814
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,599
你帮我下了这个决心
to take the responsibility yourself.

815
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:39,762
莉娅公主
Princess Leia, before your execution...

816
00:57:39,895 --> 00:57:41,555
在你被处决之前
I would like you to be my guest...

817
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:45,140
我希望你能参加我的战斗基地的开幕礼
at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.

818
00:57:45,276 --> 00:57:48,360
再也没有一个星球敢违抗帝国的统治了
No star system will dare oppose the emperor now.

819
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:50,895
塔金你越想巩固你的统治
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

820
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:53,737
就会有越多的反抗
the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

821
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:56,822
但显示了这个基地的威力之后就不会
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.

822
00:57:56,955 --> 00:57:59,327
你也帮我决定了
In a way, you have determined...

823
00:57:59,457 --> 00:58:02,293
哪个星球成为他的第一个目标
the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first.

824
00:58:02,419 --> 00:58:04,246
既然你不愿意告诉我们
Since you are reluctant...

825
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:07,297
叛军的基地所在
to provide us with the location of the rebel base...

826
00:58:07,424 --> 00:58:10,295
我只能选择你的故乡阿尔德兰
I have chosen to test this station's destructive power...

827
00:58:10,427 --> 00:58:13,428
作为我的第一个试验品了
on your home planet of Alderaan.

828
00:58:13,555 --> 00:58:14,718
不！那是个和平的地方
No! Alderaan is peaceful.

829
00:58:14,848 --> 00:58:16,307
我们什么武器也没有，你不可以…
We have no weapons. You can't possibly...

830
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:18,426
你想要另一个目标吗？军事目标？
You would prefer another target? A military target?

831
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,052
那就说出来啊
Then name the system.

832
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,274
我已经厌倦了，这可是最后一次机会
I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time.

833
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,071
叛军基地在哪里？
Where is the rebel base?

834
00:58:32,617 --> 00:58:34,775
塔图因
Dantooine.

835
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,322
他们在塔图因
They're on Dantooine.

836
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:38,826
你看，维德勋爵
There. You see, Lord Vader?

837
00:58:38,957 --> 00:58:40,368
她也是讲道理的
She can be reasonable.

838
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,291
继续行动，准备好了就发射
Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.

839
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:43,877
什么？
What?

840
00:58:44,004 --> 00:58:45,332
你太容易相信人了
You're far too trusting.

841
00:58:45,464 --> 00:58:46,922
塔图因太远了
Dantooine is too remote...

842
00:58:47,049 --> 00:58:49,540
显示不了他的威力，不过别急
to make an effective demonstration, but don't worry.

843
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:52,547
我们会慢慢跟你的叛军朋友算账的
We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.

844
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:53,759
不！
No!

845
00:58:55,015 --> 00:58:57,138
准备发射
Commence primary ignition.

846
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,583
你还好吧？怎么了？
Are you all right? What's wrong?

847
00:59:23,712 --> 00:59:26,084
我感觉气不太稳定
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

848
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:27,709
好像无数的声音
as if millions of voices...

849
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:29,715
在恐惧中尖叫
suddenly cried out in terror...

850
00:59:29,843 --> 00:59:31,385
然后忽然安静下来了
and were suddenly silenced.

851
00:59:31,511 --> 00:59:34,263
我想是有什么不好的事发生了
I fear something terrible has happened.

852
00:59:35,683 --> 00:59:38,352
你继续练习
You'd better get on with your exercises.

853
00:59:40,437 --> 00:59:43,142
现在你不用担心那些臭虫了八
Well, you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs.

854
00:59:43,274 --> 00:59:45,231
我说了我会甩掉他们的
I told you I'd outrun them.

855
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,320
有人谢我了吗？
Don't everybody thank me at once.

856
00:59:51,449 --> 00:59:55,910
我们不久就会到阿尔德兰了
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours.

857
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,211
小心了，R2
Now be careful, R2.

858
01:00:13,263 --> 01:00:14,806
啊
Argh!

859
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:16,675
这是他自找的，乱叫也不会帮你的
He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.

860
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:19,596
就让让他吧，惹恼一个伍基人是不明智的
Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

861
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:22,054
但是没人会怕一个猩猩
But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.

862
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:25,226
那是因为猩猩不会把手臂
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets...

863
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:26,735
从松了的接口里拔出来
when they lose.

864
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:28,900
伍基人知道怎么做
Wookiees are known to do that.

865
01:00:30,782 --> 01:00:33,237
我明白了
I see your point, sir.

866
01:00:33,368 --> 01:00:34,743
我有个新的建议
I suggest a new strategy, R2.

867
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:36,328
让伍基人赢
Let the Wookiee win.

868
01:00:54,264 --> 01:00:58,428
记住了，绝地武士能感觉到气从身体里流过
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

869
01:00:58,561 --> 01:01:00,553
你是说它控制你的行动？
You mean it controls your actions?

870
01:01:00,688 --> 01:01:03,605
部分的，但他也会服从你的指挥
Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

871
01:01:08,112 --> 01:01:11,149
那些虚伪的宗教和古老的武器
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match...

872
01:01:11,282 --> 01:01:12,942
并不怎么适合你
for a good blaster at your side, kid.

873
01:01:13,076 --> 01:01:15,364
你并不相信气，对吗？
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

874
01:01:15,495 --> 01:01:18,745
小子，我什么地方都去过
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.

875
01:01:18,873 --> 01:01:20,416
也见过不少奇怪的东西
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

876
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:22,831
但是我却永远不能相信
but I've never seen anything to make me believe...

877
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:26,412
有一种力量能控制一切
there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.

878
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:30,628
没有任何奇怪的力量能够控制我的命运的
There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny.

879
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:34,711
这只是些小把戏用来唬人的而已
It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

880
01:01:34,848 --> 01:01:37,719
卢克，我建议你再试一次
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

881
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:40,769
随心所欲
This time, let go your conscious self...

882
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,855
完全不受约束
and act on instinct.

883
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:48,270
面罩放下之后我什么都看不见了
With the blast shield down, I can't even see.

884
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,779
那我还怎么战斗阿？
How am I supposed to fight?

885
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:50,855
你的眼睛会欺骗你的
Your eyes can deceive you.

886
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,069
不能相信他们
Don't trust them.

887
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:03,790
用你的感觉
Stretch out with your feelings.

888
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:20,392
瞧，你做的到的
You see? You can do it.

889
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:22,145
我觉得是幸运
I call it luck.

890
01:02:22,273 --> 01:02:24,846
我觉得从来就没有幸运
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.

891
01:02:24,984 --> 01:02:27,356
也许对静止的物体有用
Look, good against remotes is one thing.

892
01:02:27,486 --> 01:02:30,357
但对于活动的敌人却又完全不一样了
Good against the living, that's something else.

893
01:02:31,824 --> 01:02:33,449
看来我们到阿尔德兰了
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.

894
01:02:36,788 --> 01:02:38,068
我感觉到了一些东西
You know, I did feel something.

895
01:02:38,206 --> 01:02:39,369
我几乎就能看见了
I could almost see the remote.

896
01:02:39,499 --> 01:02:40,412
很好
That's good.

897
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:42,369
你已经为你的将来
You've taken your first step...

898
01:02:42,502 --> 01:02:44,294
迈出了坚实的一步
into a larger world.

899
01:02:48,759 --> 01:02:49,873
怎么了？
Yes?

900
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,797
我们的侦察船到了塔图因
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

901
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,803
他们找到了叛军基地
They found the remains of a rebel base...

902
01:02:54,932 --> 01:02:57,257
但他们估计叛军已经撤离了有一段时间了
but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.

903
01:02:57,393 --> 01:03:00,928
他们现在正在做地毯式的搜寻
They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.

904
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:04,017
她撒谎！
She lied. She lied to us!

905
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,855
我跟你说了她永远不会
I told you she would never...

906
01:03:06,986 --> 01:03:09,358
背叛那群叛军的
consciously betray the rebellion.

907
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:11,446
马上处决她
Terminate her immediately.

908
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:15,734
楚伊，准备好了
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.

909
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,246
把引擎关掉
Cut in the sublight engines.

910
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:21,165
妈的…
What the...

911
01:03:24,254 --> 01:03:26,626
我们从外太空进入了流星雨区域
We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.

912
01:03:26,757 --> 01:03:27,955
应该是行星撞击产生的吧
Some kind of asteroid collision.

913
01:03:28,091 --> 01:03:29,005
但是图表上却没有显示
It's not on any of the charts.

914
01:03:29,134 --> 01:03:30,379
怎么了？
What's going on?

915
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,752
我们的位置正确无误，但是却没有阿尔德兰
Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.

916
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:34,133
什么意思？那它去哪儿了？
What do you mean? Where is it?

917
01:03:34,264 --> 01:03:35,509
我也想问这个问题
That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid.

918
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:37,016
他不在了，被完整的消灭了
It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.

919
01:03:37,142 --> 01:03:38,056
什么？怎么做到的？
What? How?

920
01:03:38,185 --> 01:03:39,810
被帝国毁灭了
Destroyed by the Empire.

921
01:03:39,937 --> 01:03:42,226
就算是整个帝国舰队也不能消灭整颗行星阿
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.

922
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:43,685
他会需要一千艘战舰的火力…
It would take 1,000 ships with more firepower than...

923
01:03:45,693 --> 01:03:47,484
又有一艘飞船过来了
There's another ship coming in.

924
01:03:47,612 --> 01:03:48,561
也许他们知道发生了什么
Maybe they know what happened.

925
01:03:48,696 --> 01:03:49,894
这是帝国的战船
It's an imperial fighter.

926
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:52,653
他盯上我们了！
It followed us!

927
01:03:52,784 --> 01:03:54,776
不，这是艘短程战船
No. It's a short-range fighter.

928
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:56,904
这里没有任何基地，它是从哪里来的？
There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?

929
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:01,910
看起来它走的很急
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.

930
01:04:02,043 --> 01:04:02,957
如果他们认出我们的话就会有大麻烦了
If they identify us, we're in big trouble.

931
01:04:03,086 --> 01:04:04,035
看来我有办法
Not if I can help it.

932
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:05,202
楚伊，扰乱他的通信系统
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

933
01:04:05,338 --> 01:04:06,204
让他走也是个不错的选择
It would be as well to let it go.

934
01:04:06,339 --> 01:04:07,253
他离我们的射程太远了
It's too far out of range.

935
01:04:07,382 --> 01:04:08,580
不会很久的
Not for long.

936
01:04:11,511 --> 01:04:15,640
那样小的战船是不能独自进入这么深的太空的
A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.

937
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:18,387
他应该是从整个战队里走丢了
He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.

938
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:20,143
他不会活到
Well, he ain't gonna be around long enough...

939
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:21,385
透露我们的踪迹了
to tell anybody about us.

940
01:04:23,899 --> 01:04:25,691
看，他正飞向那个小的卫星
Look at him. He's heading for that small moon.

941
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:28,440
我想我可以在他抵达之前击落他
I think I can get him before he gets there. He's almost in range.

942
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:32,023
这不是卫星
That's no moon.

943
01:04:32,158 --> 01:04:33,617
是一个空间站
It's a space station.

944
01:04:33,743 --> 01:04:35,534
哪有这么大的空间站阿
It's too big to be a space station.

945
01:04:38,873 --> 01:04:41,281
我有一种不祥的预感
I have a very bad feeling about this.

946
01:04:41,418 --> 01:04:43,161
掉头
Turn the ship around.

947
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:45,453
没错，快掉头！
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse!

948
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:47,795
楚伊，把备用能源也用上！
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

949
01:04:52,012 --> 01:04:54,468
楚伊，快把备用能源也用上！
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!

950
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,558
为什么我们还在前进？
Why are we still moving towards it?!

951
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,477
我们被吸住了
We're caught in a tractor beam. It's pulling us in!

952
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:02,229
你一定能做什么的！
There's got to be something you can do!

953
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,732
我什么也不能做，小子
There's nothing I can do about it, kid.

954
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,056
已经是全速了，我要关引擎了
I'm at full power. I'm gonna have to shut down.

955
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,687
他们不会那么容易逮到我的
They're not gonna get me without a fight.

956
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,521
你赢不了的…
You can't win...

957
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,782
但还有更好的方法
but there are alternatives to fighting.

958
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:33,545
327号仓位准备
Clear Bay 327.

959
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,006
我们将打开磁场
We are opening the magnetic field.

960
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:51,855
到你们的岗位上去！
To your stations!

961
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:53,272
跟我来
Come with me.

962
01:05:57,205 --> 01:05:58,747
把所有防护网关上
Close all outboard shields.

963
01:05:58,873 --> 01:06:00,831
把所有防护网关上
Close all outboard shields.

964
01:06:02,294 --> 01:06:03,325
怎么了？
Yes?

965
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:04,872
我们抓获了一艘货船
We've captured a freighter...

966
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:06,285
他正试图进入阿尔德兰的废墟
entering the remains of the Alderaan system.

967
01:06:06,423 --> 01:06:08,131
他的外形
Its markings match those of a ship...

968
01:06:08,258 --> 01:06:10,666
跟逃离的那艘吻合
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.

969
01:06:10,802 --> 01:06:14,302
他们应该是准备营救公主的
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.

970
01:06:14,431 --> 01:06:17,349
看来她对我们还有一些作用
She may yet be of some use to us.

971
01:06:22,106 --> 01:06:26,056
1号，5号，7号，9号撤离岗位
Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9. Release charge.

972
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:29,901
316到指挥室报道
316, report to control.

973
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:34,949
船上一个人也没有
There's no one on board, sir.

974
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:37,783
根据记录指示，船员在起飞后就遗弃了这艘船
According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after take-off.

975
01:06:37,914 --> 01:06:39,788
这一定是一个诱饵
It must be a decoy, sir.

976
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,375
逃生舱也不见了
Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

977
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:42,367
找到任何机器人吗？
Did you find any droids?

978
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:43,368
没有，长官
No, sir.

979
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:45,412
即使有的话应该也逃生了
If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.

980
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:47,041
派一个搜索队上去
Send a scanning crew aboard.

981
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:48,965
我要彻彻底底检查这艘船
I want every part of this ship checked.

982
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:50,041
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

983
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:51,552
我感觉到了…
I sense something...

984
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:54,632
一种好久没有的感觉
a presence I've not felt since...

985
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:58,851
叫搜查队来
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.

986
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:00,686
我要检查这艘船
I want every part of this ship checked.

987
01:07:09,781 --> 01:07:11,738
里面没人
There's no one here.

988
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,374
还好你有这些小仓位
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.

989
01:07:22,502 --> 01:07:23,913
那是走私货物用的
I use them for smuggling.

990
01:07:24,045 --> 01:07:25,670
我从来就没想过我会走私自己
I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

991
01:07:25,797 --> 01:07:27,126
这太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

992
01:07:27,257 --> 01:07:28,502
即使我能起飞
Even if I could take off...

993
01:07:28,633 --> 01:07:30,009
我也过不了那磁场
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

994
01:07:30,135 --> 01:07:31,546
这个由我来解决
Leave that to me.

995
01:07:31,678 --> 01:07:34,430
我就知道你这笨蛋会说这个
Damn fool, I knew that you were gonna say that.

996
01:07:34,556 --> 01:07:35,837
你说跟着笨蛋的人
Who's the more foolish...

997
01:07:35,974 --> 01:07:37,967
是不是更笨呢？
the fool or the fool who follows him?

998
01:07:46,777 --> 01:07:48,153
现在就把船交给你
The ship's all yours.

999
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:50,153
如果找到什么的话
If the scanners pick up anything...

1000
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:52,155
马上报告
report it immediately.

1001
01:07:52,283 --> 01:07:54,075
好的，我们走
All right, let's go.

1002
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,426
下面的人！
Hey, down there!

1003
01:08:12,471 --> 01:08:14,510
你们可以帮一下忙吗？
Could you give us a hand with this?

1004
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:26,019
TK-421，为什么你们不在岗位上？
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

1005
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:28,441
TK-421，收到了吗？
TK-421, do you copy?

1006
01:08:40,709 --> 01:08:42,535
你先接管，信号不太好
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.

1007
01:08:42,669 --> 01:08:44,496
我看看能做什么
I'll see what I can do.

1008
01:09:00,855 --> 01:09:03,856
他的叫声和你的嘈杂声没把他们引来
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight...

1009
01:09:03,983 --> 01:09:06,521
还真是一个奇迹
it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.

1010
01:09:06,652 --> 01:09:08,147
让他们来啊
Bring them on!

1011
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:09,394
我宁愿堂堂正正打一架也不要偷偷摸摸的
I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneakin' around.

1012
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:11,488
我们已经找到电脑接口了
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

1013
01:09:11,616 --> 01:09:14,368
插进去，他应该可以破解整个帝国网络
Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network.

1014
01:09:24,588 --> 01:09:27,257
他说他找到了
He says he's found the main controls...

1015
01:09:27,382 --> 01:09:29,754
能源系统的主控制
to the power beam that's holding the ship here.

1016
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:32,008
他会找出准确的位置
He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.

1017
01:09:32,137 --> 01:09:34,807
磁场跟主反应堆
The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor...

1018
01:09:34,932 --> 01:09:36,343
一共有7个联系
in seven locations.

1019
01:09:36,475 --> 01:09:37,969
任何一处断连
A power loss at one of the terminals...

1020
01:09:38,102 --> 01:09:40,640
都可以让飞船离开
will allow the ship to leave.

1021
01:09:40,771 --> 01:09:43,606
我想你们应该帮不上忙
I don't think you boys can help.

1022
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:45,441
我要一个人去
I must go alone.

1023
01:09:45,568 --> 01:09:47,145
随便吧
Whatever you say.

1024
01:09:47,278 --> 01:09:48,986
我已经仁至义尽了
I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.

1025
01:09:49,113 --> 01:09:50,572
我跟你一起去
I want to go with you.

1026
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:52,940
要有耐心，卢克
Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.

1027
01:09:53,076 --> 01:09:54,653
东西一定要安全的送到
They must be delivered safely...

1028
01:09:54,786 --> 01:09:57,787
否则其他系统也会有跟阿尔德兰一样的命运
or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.

1029
01:09:57,914 --> 01:10:01,959
你跟我的命运不同
Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.

1030
01:10:05,172 --> 01:10:08,956
原力会跟你同在的
The Force will be with you always.

1031
01:10:17,862 --> 01:10:19,403
这是你说过的，楚伊
You said it, Chewie.

1032
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:22,945
你从哪里找来这么一个老顽固？
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

1033
01:10:23,075 --> 01:10:24,948
本是一个很好的人
Ben is a great man.

1034
01:10:25,078 --> 01:10:27,568
没错，好的老是惹来麻烦
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.

1035
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:29,032
你也没有给出什么好的建议阿
I didn't hear you give any ideas.

1036
01:10:29,164 --> 01:10:30,492
任何事都比四处闲逛
Well, anything's better than just hangin' around...

1037
01:10:30,624 --> 01:10:31,786
然后等着被他们发现好
waiting for 'em to pick us up.

1038
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:32,781
你以为…
Who do you think...

1039
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:35,460
怎么了？
What is it?

1040
01:10:35,587 --> 01:10:37,626
我不是很清楚
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

1041
01:10:37,755 --> 01:10:40,080
他不停的说我找到她了，她在那里
He says "I've found her" and keeps repeating "She's here."

1042
01:10:40,216 --> 01:10:42,920
他找到谁了？
Well, who... who has he found?

1043
01:10:43,053 --> 01:10:43,965
莉娅公主
Princess Leia.

1044
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:45,754
公主？她在这儿？
The princess? She's here?!

1045
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:46,800
公主？
Princess?

1046
01:10:46,931 --> 01:10:48,175
她在哪里？
Where? Where is she?

1047
01:10:48,307 --> 01:10:49,551
什么公主啊？
Princess? What's going on?

1048
01:10:54,312 --> 01:10:57,763
第五层，AA-23号囚室
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

1049
01:11:01,904 --> 01:11:05,236
好像她马上就要被处决了
I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.

1050
01:11:05,364 --> 01:11:06,359
不！
Oh, no!

1051
01:11:06,491 --> 01:11:07,865
我们得做点什么！
We've got to do something!

1052
01:11:07,992 --> 01:11:09,533
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1053
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:10,858
机器人是她的
The droids belong to her.

1054
01:11:10,995 --> 01:11:11,860
她就是信息里的人
She's the one in the message.

1055
01:11:11,996 --> 01:11:13,110
我们要帮助她
We got to help her.

1056
01:11:13,247 --> 01:11:14,444
不要胡思乱想了
Now look, don't get any funny ideas.

1057
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:15,695
那老头让我们在这里呆着
The old man wants us to wait right here.

1058
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,207
但他不知道公主在这里
But he didn't know she was here.

1059
01:11:17,334 --> 01:11:19,409
找到去囚室的路
Just find a way back into that detention block.

1060
01:11:19,545 --> 01:11:20,493
我什么地方也不会去的
I'm not going anywhere.

1061
01:11:20,629 --> 01:11:21,708
他们要处决她了
They're going to execute her.

1062
01:11:21,838 --> 01:11:23,296
刚刚你还说
Look, a few minutes ago, you said...

1063
01:11:23,423 --> 01:11:24,371
你不想在这里等死
you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.

1064
01:11:24,507 --> 01:11:25,502
现在你又想留下来了？
Now all you want to do is stay?

1065
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:27,293
但我从来没想过
Marching into the detention area...

1066
01:11:27,427 --> 01:11:28,541
要去囚室
is not what I had in mind.

1067
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:29,709
但他们要杀了她！
But they're gonna kill her!

1068
01:11:29,846 --> 01:11:31,470
总比杀了我好
Better her than me.

1069
01:11:39,314 --> 01:11:40,558
她很富有
She's rich.

1070
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:44,395
富有？
Rich?

1071
01:11:44,526 --> 01:11:46,103
又有钱又有势
Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

1072
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:49,236
如果你去救她的话，报酬可是…
Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...

1073
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:50,525
什么？
What?

1074
01:11:50,657 --> 01:11:52,067
超出你的想象
Well, more well than you can imagine.

1075
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,571
我的胃口可大了
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

1076
01:11:54,703 --> 01:11:55,733
你会得到的
You'll get it.

1077
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:56,901
最好这样
I better.

1078
01:11:57,038 --> 01:11:58,448
你会的
You will.

1079
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:00,074
小子，最好你说得没错
All right, kid. You better be right about this.

1080
01:12:00,207 --> 01:12:01,238
当然
All right.

1081
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:02,240
你的计划是？
What's your plan?

1082
01:12:02,376 --> 01:12:03,656
恩
Um...

1083
01:12:03,794 --> 01:12:07,328
你可以把那手铐递给我吗？
3PO, hand me those binders there, will you?

1084
01:12:07,464 --> 01:12:09,420
好的
O.K.

1085
01:12:09,549 --> 01:12:11,671
我现在要把它戴在你身上
Now... I'm gonna put these on you.

1086
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:16,841
汉，你来吧
O.K. Han, you... you put those on.

1087
01:12:16,973 --> 01:12:18,051
别担心，楚伊
Don't worry, Chewie.

1088
01:12:18,182 --> 01:12:19,640
我想我知道他想做什么
I think I know what he has in mind.

1089
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:22,554
卢克主人，请允许我问一下
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

1090
01:12:22,687 --> 01:12:25,438
我跟R2被发现的话该怎么办？
but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?

1091
01:12:25,606 --> 01:12:27,064
关上门
Lock the door.

1092
01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:29,396
希望他们没有炸药吧
And hope they don't have blasters.

1093
01:12:29,527 --> 01:12:31,234
这听起来并不怎么可靠
That isn't very reassuring.

1094
01:12:51,756 --> 01:12:53,130
517去检查控制室
517 to scanner control.

1095
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:56,541
517去检查控制室
517 to scanner control.

1096
01:13:00,097 --> 01:13:02,136
316向控制室报道
316, report to control.

1097
01:13:05,435 --> 01:13:07,972
53到上层闸门
53 to upper bay door.

1098
01:13:08,104 --> 01:13:10,725
53到上层闸门
53 to upper bay door.

1099
01:13:22,743 --> 01:13:24,984
在这个头盔下我什么也看不见
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

1100
01:13:55,232 --> 01:13:57,852
这不会管用的
This is not gonna work.

1101
01:13:57,984 --> 01:13:59,097
你前面为什么不讲？
Why didn't you say so before?

1102
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:01,191
我说了阿
I did say so before.

1103
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:19,583
你们要把这东西带去哪里？
Where are you taking this... thing?

1104
01:14:19,713 --> 01:14:22,417
转去1138号囚室
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

1105
01:14:22,549 --> 01:14:25,039
我没有被通知
I wasn't notified.

1106
01:14:25,176 --> 01:14:27,298
让我确认一下
I'll have to clear it.

1107
01:14:33,767 --> 01:14:35,046
小心，他的手铐松了！
Look out! He's loose!

1108
01:14:35,185 --> 01:14:36,050
他会把我们都撕成碎片的！
He'll tear us all apart!

1109
01:14:36,186 --> 01:14:37,466
我来！
I'll get him!

1110
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,745
小心！
Look out!

1111
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:14,549
我们得找到是哪间囚室先
We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in.

1112
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:16,055
是这间-2187
Here it is... 2187.

1113
01:15:16,182 --> 01:15:18,719
你去找她，我来缠住他们
You go and get her. I'll hold them here.

1114
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:24,058
一切都控制住了
Uh... Uh, everything's under control.

1115
01:15:24,189 --> 01:15:25,387
情况正常
Situation normal.

1116
01:15:25,524 --> 01:15:26,721
怎么了？
What happened?

1117
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:29,230
武器有点失常
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

1118
01:15:29,361 --> 01:15:31,566
现在都已经没问题了
but, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.

1119
01:15:31,696 --> 01:15:34,447
我们很好，谢谢
We're fine... We're all fine here now. Thank you.

1120
01:15:34,574 --> 01:15:35,736
你怎么了？
How are you?

1121
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:37,740
我们正派一个小队过去
We're sending a squad up.

1122
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:39,243
有情况，有情况！
Uh, negative, negative!

1123
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,942
我们这里的反应堆泄漏
We have a... a reactor leak here, uh, now.

1124
01:15:42,081 --> 01:15:43,111
我们需要几分钟来解决
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.

1125
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:45,075
大规模泄漏，很严重
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

1126
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:47,913
你是谁？你的号码是多少？
Who is this? What's your operating number?

1127
01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:49,158
恩
Uh...

1128
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,542
没什么意义的对话
Boring conversation anyway.

1129
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:54,508
卢克，有人要来了！
Luke! We're gonna have company!

1130
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,387
你会不会太矮了？
Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?

1131
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:11,389
啊？
Huh?

1132
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,067
你的制服
Oh, the uniform.

1133
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:16,770
我叫天行者卢克，我是来救你的
I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

1134
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,315
你是谁？
You're who?

1135
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:19,562
我是来救你的，我有你的R2
I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.

1136
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,778
我跟本 科努比一起来的
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

1137
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,071
本 科努比？他在哪里？
Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?

1138
01:16:22,201 --> 01:16:23,149
快！
Come on!

1139
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:26,365
他在这儿
He is here.

1140
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:28,822
欧比 旺 科努比？
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

1141
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:30,155
你为什么会这样觉得？
What makes you think so?

1142
01:16:30,293 --> 01:16:32,830
我的气在振动
A tremor in the Force.

1143
01:16:32,961 --> 01:16:34,075
上次我感觉到他
The last time I felt it...

1144
01:16:34,213 --> 01:16:36,335
是在我的老师身边
was in the presence of my old master.

1145
01:16:36,465 --> 01:16:38,920
但他应该已经死了阿
Surely he must be dead by now.

1146
01:16:39,051 --> 01:16:41,885
永远不要轻视气
Don't underestimate the Force.

1147
01:16:42,012 --> 01:16:43,884
绝地武士已经灭绝了
The Jedi are extinct.

1148
01:16:44,014 --> 01:16:46,219
他们已经在这个宇宙消失
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

1149
01:16:46,349 --> 01:16:49,764
你是他们之中唯一的幸存者了
You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.

1150
01:16:49,894 --> 01:16:51,387
怎么了
Yes.

1151
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,515
我们有一个警报
We have an emergency alert...

1152
01:16:52,647 --> 01:16:55,267
在AA-23囚室
in Detention Block AA-23.

1153
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:56,513
公主？
The princess?

1154
01:16:56,651 --> 01:16:57,930
全面警戒
Put all sections on alert.

1155
01:16:58,069 --> 01:16:59,527
欧比 旺来了
Obi-Wan is here.

1156
01:16:59,653 --> 01:17:01,645
我感觉到他的气了
The Force is with him.

1157
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:02,810
如果你的判断没错的话
If you're right...

1158
01:17:02,948 --> 01:17:04,821
他就不容许逃走
he must not be allowed to escape.

1159
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:06,443
这不是他的计划
Escape is not his plan.

1160
01:17:06,577 --> 01:17:08,236
我要单独面对他
I must face him alone.

1161
01:17:17,002 --> 01:17:19,077
到我后面！
Get behind me! Get behind me!

1162
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:31,594
看你的左边
Watch your left.

1163
01:17:31,725 --> 01:17:33,266
他们去了闸门
They went down the cell bay.

1164
01:17:35,812 --> 01:17:37,388
这里行不通
Can't get out that way.

1165
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:39,098
你把我们唯一的去路给堵住了
Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.

1166
01:17:39,232 --> 01:17:43,560
看来你是想回到你的囚室了，殿下
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.

1167
01:17:43,695 --> 01:17:45,069
C-3PO, C-3PO!
C-3PO, C-3PO!

1168
01:17:45,195 --> 01:17:46,439
怎么了？
Yes, sir?

1169
01:17:46,572 --> 01:17:48,279
有什么路能走出去吗？
Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?

1170
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,114
我们被堵住了
We've been cut off!

1171
01:17:52,328 --> 01:17:54,533
什么？我听不到
What was that? I didn't copy.

1172
01:17:54,663 --> 01:17:57,995
我说已经全面警戒了
I said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.

1173
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,915
只有主通道是开的
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out.

1174
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:02,996
你那一层的信息被限制了
All other information on your level is restricted.

1175
01:18:03,129 --> 01:18:04,622
把门打开！
Open up in there!

1176
01:18:04,755 --> 01:18:06,581
打开门！
Open up in there!

1177
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:08,375
不！
Oh, no!

1178
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:10,051
已经没有路了
There isn't any other way out!

1179
01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:17,888
我不能永远挡着他们，现在怎么办？
I can't hold them off forever! Now what?!

1180
01:18:18,018 --> 01:18:19,725
好一个营救！
This is some rescue!

1181
01:18:19,853 --> 01:18:21,513
你们进来却没有一个计划出去？
You came in here, and you didn't have a plan for getting out?

1182
01:18:21,646 --> 01:18:23,602
亲爱的，他才是策划者！
He's the brains, sweetheart!

1183
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:24,893
我没有…
Well, I didn't...

1184
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:27,563
你在干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

1185
01:18:27,694 --> 01:18:30,018
总的有个办法啊
Somebody has to save our skins.

1186
01:18:32,365 --> 01:18:34,024
进垃圾道，快！
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.

1187
01:18:40,914 --> 01:18:42,573
快进！
- Get in there! - Arrgh!

1188
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:45,542
快进去你这大家伙！
Get in there, you big furry oaf!

1189
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:46,831
我才不管那味道呢
I don't care what you smell.

1190
01:18:46,962 --> 01:18:49,748
快进去，什么也别想
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

1191
01:18:52,425 --> 01:18:53,883
好女孩！
Wonderful girl!

1192
01:18:56,012 --> 01:18:56,925
要不我就杀了她
Either I'm going to kill her...

1193
01:18:57,054 --> 01:18:59,211
要不我会开始喜欢她
or I'm beginning to like her.

1194
01:19:00,766 --> 01:19:03,470
快进去！
Get in there!

1195
01:19:10,317 --> 01:19:11,395
啊！
Ah!

1196
01:19:14,904 --> 01:19:17,655
这么个好主意
The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.

1197
01:19:17,782 --> 01:19:21,280
这是什么味道啊！
What an incredible smell you've discovered!

1198
01:19:23,912 --> 01:19:26,153
快出去
Let's get out of here.

1199
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:27,534
走开
Get away from there.

1200
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:28,614
等一下！
No, wait!

1201
01:19:35,381 --> 01:19:36,294
你忘了吗？我已经试过了！
Will you forget it?! I already tried it!

1202
01:19:36,424 --> 01:19:37,918
这里被磁场封住了
It's magnetically sealed.

1203
01:19:38,051 --> 01:19:40,090
把那东西拿开！你会杀了我们的！
Put that thing away! You're gonna get us all killed!

1204
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:42,128
没错，我的神！
Absolutely, Your Worship.

1205
01:19:42,263 --> 01:19:44,551
一切都很好直至你把我们带进来！
Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here!

1206
01:19:44,682 --> 01:19:46,175
他们不会需要多久
Ya know, it's not gonna take 'em long...

1207
01:19:46,309 --> 01:19:47,802
来知道我们去哪儿的！
to figure out what happened to us!

1208
01:19:47,935 --> 01:19:49,808
没什么比这个更糟的了
It could be worse.

1209
01:19:53,565 --> 01:19:54,809
没错
It's worse.

1210
01:19:54,942 --> 01:19:56,435
这里有生物
There's something alive in here.

1211
01:19:56,568 --> 01:19:57,943
那是你的幻觉
That's your imagination.

1212
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:00,856
有东西从我的腿边经过
Something just moved past my leg.

1213
01:20:02,573 --> 01:20:04,612
你看见了吗？
Look! Did you see that?

1214
01:20:04,742 --> 01:20:05,607
什么？
What?

1215
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:27,836
小子！
Kid!

1216
01:20:27,972 --> 01:20:28,836
卢克！
Luke!

1217
01:20:28,973 --> 01:20:30,383
卢克！
Luke!

1218
01:20:30,516 --> 01:20:31,464
卢克！
Luke!

1219
01:20:32,685 --> 01:20:33,799
卢克！
Luke!

1220
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:43,232
卢克，抓住这个！
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

1221
01:20:43,362 --> 01:20:45,769
妈的，我的枪被卡住了
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

1222
01:20:45,905 --> 01:20:47,529
哪儿？
Where?

1223
01:20:47,657 --> 01:20:48,605
随便！
Anywhere!

1224
01:20:56,499 --> 01:20:57,493
卢克！
Luke, Luke!

1225
01:21:21,231 --> 01:21:22,854
快帮他！
Help him!

1226
01:21:22,982 --> 01:21:24,060
怎么了？
What happened?

1227
01:21:24,191 --> 01:21:25,269
我不知道
I don't know.

1228
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:27,606
他们忽然松开我走了
It just let go of me and disappeared.

1229
01:21:33,909 --> 01:21:37,608
我有不祥的预感
I got a bad feeling about this.

1230
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:42,947
墙在动！
The walls are moving!

1231
01:21:43,084 --> 01:21:44,363
别站着不动！
Don't just stand there!

1232
01:21:44,502 --> 01:21:46,957
用什么东西顶住
Try and brace it with something.

1233
01:21:54,178 --> 01:21:55,636
快帮我！
Help me!

1234
01:22:08,315 --> 01:22:09,346
等一下
Wait a minute!

1235
01:22:12,153 --> 01:22:13,812
3PO！
3PO!

1236
01:22:13,946 --> 01:22:16,271
快点3PO！
Come in, 3PO!

1237
01:22:16,407 --> 01:22:17,901
3PO！
3PO!

1238
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,859
它去哪儿了？
Where could he be?

1239
01:22:24,581 --> 01:22:26,538
到位，快找
Take over. See to him.

1240
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:31,034
在这儿
Look, there.

1241
01:22:32,422 --> 01:22:33,796
他们疯了
They're madmen.

1242
01:22:33,923 --> 01:22:35,168
他们去监狱那一层了
They're heading for the prison level.

1243
01:22:35,299 --> 01:22:36,792
如果够快的话也许还能抓到他们
If you hurry, you might catch them.

1244
01:22:36,926 --> 01:22:38,383
跟我走
Follow me.

1245
01:22:42,515 --> 01:22:44,553
你在这里守着
You stand guard.

1246
01:22:48,437 --> 01:22:49,894
快
Come on.

1247
01:22:53,608 --> 01:22:55,065
哦！
Oh!

1248
01:22:58,613 --> 01:23:01,981
我的朋友出了一点故障
All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here.

1249
01:23:02,117 --> 01:23:05,532
如果你不介意我想带他去维修
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.

1250
01:23:05,661 --> 01:23:07,119
好
All right.

1251
01:23:19,091 --> 01:23:19,955
3PO！
3PO!

1252
01:23:20,092 --> 01:23:21,419
快，3PO！
Come in, 3PO!

1253
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:22,960
3PO！
3PO!

1254
01:23:23,094 --> 01:23:24,468
到上面去！
Get on top!

1255
01:23:24,595 --> 01:23:25,709
我上不去
I can't.

1256
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:28,716
他跑去哪里？3PO
Where could he be?! 3PO!

1257
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:30,888
3PO，你答话！
3PO, will you come in!

1258
01:23:31,018 --> 01:23:32,392
他们不在这里
They aren't here.

1259
01:23:32,519 --> 01:23:33,716
一定出事了
Something must have happened to them.

1260
01:23:33,854 --> 01:23:35,228
看他们是否被抓了
See if they've been captured.

1261
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:36,350
快点！
Hurry.

1262
01:23:39,817 --> 01:23:41,394
有件事可确定
One thing's for sure...

1263
01:23:41,528 --> 01:23:42,937
我们都要变瘦了
we're all gonna be a lot thinner.

1264
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:47,690
到上面去
Get on top of it.

1265
01:23:47,826 --> 01:23:48,904
我在努力了
I'm trying.

1266
01:23:53,873 --> 01:23:55,699
谢天谢地！ 帝国军还没找到他们
Thank goodness they haven't found them.

1267
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:56,828
他们去哪里了呢？
Where could they be?

1268
01:23:59,378 --> 01:24:00,919
用通话器？
"Use the comlink"?

1269
01:24:01,046 --> 01:24:03,714
我忘了我把它关了
Oh, my. I forgot. I turned it off.

1270
01:24:06,467 --> 01:24:09,040
你在吗？先生？
Are you there, sir?

1271
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:10,921
3PO！
3PO!

1272
01:24:11,055 --> 01:24:12,086
我们发生了点问题…
We've had some problems.

1273
01:24:12,223 --> 01:24:13,337
你闭嘴听我说好吗？
Will you shut up and listen to me?!

1274
01:24:13,475 --> 01:24:16,306
关闭囚犯区的垃圾库电力 好吗？！
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will ya?!

1275
01:24:16,435 --> 01:24:18,059
你听到了吗？
Do you copy!?

1276
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:21,602
把囚犯区的垃圾库电力都关闭！
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level!

1277
01:24:21,732 --> 01:24:24,269
把囚犯区的垃圾库电力都关闭！
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level!

1278
01:24:24,401 --> 01:24:26,108
没错！ 全部关闭，快呀！
No! Shut them all down. Hurry!

1279
01:24:38,581 --> 01:24:39,493
什么？
What?

1280
01:24:39,624 --> 01:24:41,117
哈哈！
Ha ha!

1281
01:24:43,252 --> 01:24:45,327
你听他们的叫声，他们就要死了，R2！
Listen to them. They're dying, R2!

1282
01:24:45,462 --> 01:24:47,039
天咒我吧！
Curse my metal body!

1283
01:24:47,172 --> 01:24:51,039
我的动作不够快 全是我的错，我可怜的主人
I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master.

1284
01:24:51,176 --> 01:24:52,718
我们没事了！ 太棒了，你做的太好了
We're all right! You did great!

1285
01:24:52,844 --> 01:24:55,251
打开这里的压力门
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch...

1286
01:24:55,388 --> 01:24:57,510
我们在哪里？
on unit number... Where are we?

1287
01:24:57,641 --> 01:25:00,973
我们在 32-63-827 下面
3263827!

1288
01:25:45,352 --> 01:25:48,352
只要避免再有女性建议，
If we can just avoid any more female advice...

1289
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:50,685
我们就能离开这儿
we ought to be able to get outta here.

1290
01:25:50,815 --> 01:25:52,273
我们快走吧！
Well, let's get moving.

1291
01:25:53,484 --> 01:25:55,357
你去那儿？
Where are you going?

1292
01:25:56,653 --> 01:25:58,063
等等！ 他们会听到
No, wait! They'll hear!

1293
01:25:59,323 --> 01:26:01,149
过来！ 你这懦夫
Come here, you big coward.

1294
01:26:01,283 --> 01:26:02,231
楚伊，过来
Chewie, come here.

1295
01:26:02,368 --> 01:26:03,695
听着！
Listen...

1296
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:06,400
我不知你是谁？从何而来
I don't know who you are or where you came from...

1297
01:26:06,538 --> 01:26:09,454
从现在开始，照我的话作，好吗？
but from now on, you do as I tell you, OK?

1298
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:11,491
听着！殿下…
Look, Your Worshipfulness...

1299
01:26:11,626 --> 01:26:13,499
我们先弄清楚
let's get one thing straight.

1300
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:16,414
我只听命于一个人，我！
I take orders from just one person... me.

1301
01:26:16,547 --> 01:26:18,539
你还活着真是奇迹
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1302
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:21,924
谁来搬开这活动地板？
Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?

1303
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:25,172
没有奖赏值得我经受这一切
No reward is worth this.

1304
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:36,429
请把我例行的报告给我
Give me regular reports, please.

1305
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:37,644
好的
Right.

1306
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,235
你知道是怎么回事吗？
Do you know what's going on?

1307
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,104
也许又是一次演习吧
Maybe it's another drill.

1308
01:26:46,992 --> 01:26:49,779
看到那个新的 VT-16了吗？
You seen that new VT-16?

1309
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:52,236
听别人说了
Yeah. Some of the other guys were telling me about it.

1310
01:26:52,372 --> 01:26:54,447
他们说它值得一看
They say it's... it's quite a thing to see...

1311
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:56,658
那是什么？
What was that?

1312
01:26:56,793 --> 01:26:58,335
没什么正在排气
Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.

1313
01:26:58,462 --> 01:26:59,410
不要担心
Don't worry about it.

1314
01:27:04,968 --> 01:27:05,832
船就在那边了
There she is.

1315
01:27:05,969 --> 01:27:07,166
C3PO！ 你听到吗？
C-3PO? Do you copy?

1316
01:27:07,303 --> 01:27:08,251
是的！
Yes, sir.

1317
01:27:08,387 --> 01:27:10,295
- 你安全吗？ - 目前是
- Are you safe? - For the moment.

1318
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:12,718
我们在主机棚，飞船那边
We're in the main hangar across from the ship.

1319
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:16,345
我们就在你上面！ 待命
We're right above you. Stand by.

1320
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:18,138
你的船？
You came in that thing?

1321
01:27:18,271 --> 01:27:19,301
你比我想的还勇敢
You're braver than I thought.

1322
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:20,718
很好！ 走吧
Nice! Come on.

1323
01:27:24,903 --> 01:27:25,767
是他们！
It's them!

1324
01:27:25,904 --> 01:27:26,852
开火！
Blast them!

1325
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:28,983
回船去
Get back to the ship!

1326
01:27:29,115 --> 01:27:30,525
你去哪里？回来！
Where are you going? Come back!

1327
01:27:30,658 --> 01:27:31,653
他的确有勇气！
He certainly has courage.

1328
01:27:31,784 --> 01:27:33,112
如果他这样丢掉自己的性命…
What good will it do us...

1329
01:27:33,244 --> 01:27:35,401
对我们会有什么好处呢？来
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

1330
01:28:00,394 --> 01:28:03,015
我们转弯转错了
I think we took a wrong turn.

1331
01:28:07,317 --> 01:28:08,265
没有锁
There's no lock.

1332
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:13,565
这应让能挡住他们一阵
That oughta hold them for a while.

1333
01:28:13,698 --> 01:28:15,156
快！ 我们得过去
Quick! We've got to get across.

1334
01:28:15,283 --> 01:28:16,990
找出控制器把桥延伸出去
Find the controls that extend the bridge.

1335
01:28:17,118 --> 01:28:18,492
我刚把它打坏
I think I just blasted it.

1336
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:20,410
但他们就要过来了呀！
They're coming through!

1337
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:43,762
拿着！
Here, hold this.

1338
01:29:00,658 --> 01:29:01,772
他们来了
Here they come.

1339
01:29:11,961 --> 01:29:13,751
好运
For luck.

1340
01:29:19,634 --> 01:29:22,551
他们可能单独行动
We think they may be splitting up.

1341
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:25,929
已经到了5楼或6楼
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1342
01:29:39,487 --> 01:29:40,565
他们人呢？
Where could they be?

1343
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:47,323
把门关上！
Close the blast doors!

1344
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:56,914
把门打开！ 把门打开！
Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!

1345
01:30:15,311 --> 01:30:17,683
我在等你！欧比旺！
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.

1346
01:30:17,814 --> 01:30:19,307
我们终于再度见面
We meet again at last.

1347
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,523
循环完成
The circle is now complete.

1348
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:25,106
我离开你时是学生
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1349
01:30:25,237 --> 01:30:27,276
如今我是大师了
Now I am the master.

1350
01:30:27,406 --> 01:30:30,323
邪恶大师，达斯・维德
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1351
01:30:49,718 --> 01:30:51,959
你的力量太弱了，老头子
Your powers are weak, old man.

1352
01:30:52,096 --> 01:30:53,672
你赢不了的，达斯・维德
You can't win, Darth.

1353
01:30:53,806 --> 01:30:55,762
如果你将我击倒…
If you strike me down...

1354
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:59,223
我会比你所想像的还要有力
I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

1355
01:31:05,942 --> 01:31:08,692
你不该回来
You should not have come back.

1356
01:31:34,468 --> 01:31:37,137
我们快离开这里？
Didn't we just leave this party?

1357
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:39,920
你们被什么耽误了？
What kept you?

1358
01:31:40,057 --> 01:31:40,970
我们遇到些老朋友
We, uh, ran into some old friends.

1359
01:31:41,099 --> 01:31:42,129
船没事吧？
The ship all right?

1360
01:31:42,267 --> 01:31:43,974
看上去很好，只要我们能上得去
It seems OK, if we can get to it.

1361
01:31:44,102 --> 01:31:45,893
希望老头消除了磁力牵引光束
I just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.

1362
01:32:00,409 --> 01:32:01,606
看！
Look!

1363
01:32:05,247 --> 01:32:07,073
走吧！ R2，我们要走了
Come on, R2, we're going.

1364
01:32:08,959 --> 01:32:09,989
这是我们的机会，快走！
Now's our chance! Go!

1365
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:14,828
本？
Ben?

1366
01:32:30,396 --> 01:32:32,103
不！
No!

1367
01:32:40,196 --> 01:32:41,061
快来呀！
Come on!

1368
01:32:41,197 --> 01:32:42,311
快来呀！
Come on!

1369
01:32:42,449 --> 01:32:43,907
快来呀！
Come on!

1370
01:32:44,034 --> 01:32:45,147
卢克，已经太迟了！
Luke, it's too late!

1371
01:32:45,284 --> 01:32:47,027
把开关打坏！
Blast the door, kid!

1372
01:32:56,795 --> 01:32:59,036
快跑！卢克！
Run, Luke, run!

1373
01:33:01,175 --> 01:33:04,009
希望老头破坏了磁力牵引光束…
I hope that old man got that tractor beam out of commission...

1374
01:33:04,135 --> 01:33:06,708
我们就能迅速离去 好！ 发动！
or this is gonna be a real short trip. O.K. Hit it!

1375
01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:39,449
如果有他们的哨兵飞船
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1376
01:33:39,585 --> 01:33:41,244
挡住它们
Hold them off.

1377
01:33:41,378 --> 01:33:45,042
升起防护网，将主要炮管装满
Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns.

1378
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,094
我无法相信他已死了
I can't believe he's gone.

1379
01:33:57,768 --> 01:34:00,223
你也无能为力
There wasn't anything you could have done.

1380
01:34:00,354 --> 01:34:03,224
来吧！ 这件事还未完呢
Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet.

1381
01:34:19,414 --> 01:34:22,414
你进来了吗？好！ 保持警觉
You in, kid? OK, stay sharp.

1382
01:34:33,302 --> 01:34:34,416
他们来了！
Here they come.

1383
01:34:52,444 --> 01:34:54,270
他们来得太快！
They're coming in too fast!

1384
01:35:02,287 --> 01:35:03,745
我们的侧面失去控制！
We've lost the lateral controls!

1385
01:35:03,872 --> 01:35:06,113
不要担心！ 这船能够撑住
Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1386
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:09,624
宝贝，稳住！
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1387
01:35:31,815 --> 01:35:33,356
我打中它了！ 太好了
Got him! I got him!

1388
01:35:33,483 --> 01:35:35,724
不要就此自满
Great, kid! Don't get cocky.

1389
01:35:37,153 --> 01:35:38,777
外面还有２个！
There's still two more of them out there!

1390
01:36:12,686 --> 01:36:14,096
这就对了！ 我们成功了！
That's it! We did it!

1391
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:16,351
我们成功了！
We did it!

1392
01:36:16,481 --> 01:36:18,936
救命！ 我觉得我好像在融化！这都是你的错！
Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault!

1393
01:36:26,908 --> 01:36:28,282
他们走远了吗？
Are they away?

1394
01:36:28,409 --> 01:36:31,445
他们刚冲进超太空
They've just made the jump into hyperspace.

1395
01:36:31,579 --> 01:36:35,908
你确信追踪器装好了？
You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?

1396
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:38,710
我这可是冒很大的险
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1397
01:36:38,836 --> 01:36:40,578
这招最好有效
This had better work.

1398
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:43,465
还算成功的援救，是吧？
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1399
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:46,673
有时连我自己也感惊奇
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

1400
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,042
这并不难呀
That doesn't sound too hard.

1401
01:36:49,179 --> 01:36:50,458
他们是故意让我们走
They let us go.

1402
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:53,514
这是我们能轻易逃离的唯一解释
It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.

1403
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:54,719
轻易，你说这样是轻易？
Easy? You call that easy?

1404
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:55,798
他们追踪我们
They're tracking us.

1405
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:57,594
不可能对这条船的
Not this ship, sister.

1406
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:01,393
起码R2身上的情报未被破坏
At least the information in R2 is still intact.

1407
01:37:01,523 --> 01:37:03,147
什么情报如此重要？它带着什么？
What's so important? What's he carrying?

1408
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:06,145
那个战斗站的结构图
The technical readouts of that battle station.

1409
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:08,815
我只希望等我们分析时…
I only hope that when the data's analyzed...

1410
01:37:08,946 --> 01:37:10,523
能找出它的弱点
a weakness can be found.

1411
01:37:10,657 --> 01:37:12,150
这件事还未结束呢
It's not over yet.

1412
01:37:12,283 --> 01:37:13,990
对我可是结束了
It is for me, sister.

1413
01:37:14,118 --> 01:37:15,825
我参与此事不是为了你的革命…
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution...

1414
01:37:15,954 --> 01:37:17,780
也不是为了你
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1415
01:37:17,913 --> 01:37:19,110
我是期望有优厚的报酬
I expect to be well paid.

1416
01:37:19,248 --> 01:37:20,409
我是为钱参与此事
I'm in it for the money.

1417
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:22,497
你不用担心你的报酬
You needn't worry about your reward.

1418
01:37:22,626 --> 01:37:24,203
如果你就只爱钱…
If money is all that you love...

1419
01:37:24,336 --> 01:37:26,791
那就是你会获得的
then that's what you'll receive.

1420
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,748
你的朋友，好个佣兵
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1421
01:37:30,884 --> 01:37:33,089
我看他不关心任何事…
I wonder if he really cares about anything...

1422
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:34,713
或任何人
or anybody.

1423
01:37:34,846 --> 01:37:36,304
我关心呀！
I care.

1424
01:37:42,854 --> 01:37:45,344
所以…
So...

1425
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,974
你觉得她如何？
what do you think of her, Han?

1426
01:37:47,107 --> 01:37:48,933
我尽量不去想她，孩子
I'm trying not to, kid.

1427
01:37:49,068 --> 01:37:51,106
很好
Good.

1428
01:37:54,489 --> 01:37:57,442
不过我认为她很有胆识
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1429
01:37:59,577 --> 01:38:00,952
我不知道你说呢？
I don't know. What do you think?

1430
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:02,572
公主配我这样的人，你觉得如何…
You think a princess and a guy like me...

1431
01:38:02,706 --> 01:38:04,448
不好！
No!

1432
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:51,656
你获救了
You're safe.

1433
01:38:51,793 --> 01:38:53,037
当我们听到奥的朗的消息时…
When we heard about Alderaan...

1434
01:38:53,169 --> 01:38:54,331
我们最害怕
we feared the worst.

1435
01:38:54,462 --> 01:38:56,121
我们没时间伤心了，指挥官
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.

1436
01:38:56,256 --> 01:38:58,046
你必须使用R2身上的情况…
You must use the information in this R2 unit...

1437
01:38:58,173 --> 01:38:59,086
来策划攻击行动
to help plan the attack.

1438
01:38:59,216 --> 01:39:00,674
那是我们唯一的希望
It's our only hope.

1439
01:39:22,488 --> 01:39:23,732
是的
Yes.

1440
01:39:23,865 --> 01:39:25,274
我们正接近耶比星球
We're approaching the planet Yavin.

1441
01:39:25,407 --> 01:39:27,280
叛军基地在另一头的卫星上
The rebel base is on a moon on the far side.

1442
01:39:27,409 --> 01:39:29,946
我们打算绕耶比星飞行
We are preparing to orbit the planet.

1443
01:39:38,628 --> 01:39:40,667
帝国战斗站严密的防卫…
The battle station is heavily shielded...

1444
01:39:40,797 --> 01:39:42,587
具有的火力…
and carries a firepower...

1445
01:39:42,716 --> 01:39:44,624
比半个星际舰队还要强
greater than half the starfleet.

1446
01:39:44,758 --> 01:39:49,051
它的防卫措施是根据大型直接的攻击而设计
Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.

1447
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:54,422
单人战斗机应能穿越外层的防卫
A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.

1448
01:39:54,559 --> 01:39:56,765
请问，首长…
Pardon me for asking, sir...

1449
01:39:56,895 --> 01:39:59,765
我们小型战斗机对抗它又有何用？
but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?

1450
01:39:59,898 --> 01:40:03,397
帝国认为小型单人机…
The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter...

1451
01:40:03,526 --> 01:40:04,521
不具威胁…
to be any threat...

1452
01:40:04,652 --> 01:40:07,403
不然他们会有更严密的防卫系统
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1453
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:10,566
莉娅公主所提供的敌军分析图…
An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia...

1454
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:13,949
显示他们的基地有个弱点
has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.

1455
01:40:14,078 --> 01:40:16,782
要接近并不容易
The approach will not be easy.

1456
01:40:16,914 --> 01:40:20,033
你们必须低飞到这个狭沟…
You're required to maneuver straight down this trench...

1457
01:40:20,166 --> 01:40:23,499
然后沿着狭沟而行，直到这一点
and skim the surface to this point.

1458
01:40:23,628 --> 01:40:26,332
攻击目标区仅两米宽
The target area is only 2 meters wide.

1459
01:40:26,465 --> 01:40:28,587
是个反应炉排气口…
It's a small thermal exhaust port...

1460
01:40:28,717 --> 01:40:31,207
就在主排气口的下方
right below the main port.

1461
01:40:31,344 --> 01:40:34,463
孔道直通反应炉系统
The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.

1462
01:40:34,597 --> 01:40:37,217
正中目标能引起连锁反应…
A precise hit will start a chain reaction...

1463
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:39,555
毁灭帝国军战斗站
which should destroy the station.

1464
01:40:39,685 --> 01:40:43,267
只有正中目标才能引起连锁反应
Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.

1465
01:40:43,397 --> 01:40:44,676
此排气口有防击保护层…
The shaft is ray-shielded...

1466
01:40:44,815 --> 01:40:46,522
所以你们必须使用质子弹
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1467
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:49,105
这连电脑也办不到
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1468
01:40:49,235 --> 01:40:52,650
并非不可能的 我以前在家乡常用 T16，击中我的面包中心点
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1469
01:40:52,781 --> 01:40:55,152
那还没有两米宽
They're not much bigger than 2 meters.

1470
01:40:55,283 --> 01:40:58,651
上你们的宇宙飞船吧！ 愿原力与你们同在！
Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you.

1471
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:09,164
全速环绕耶比星球
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.

1472
01:41:09,296 --> 01:41:11,204
叛军基地所在的卫星…
The moon with the rebel base...

1473
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,627
将在30分钟内进入射程
will be in range in 30 minutes.

1474
01:41:13,759 --> 01:41:16,047
这将是一个值得纪念的日子
This will be a day long remembered.

1475
01:41:16,177 --> 01:41:18,584
我们己经见到欧比旺的末日…
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1476
01:41:18,721 --> 01:41:23,264
很快也要见到叛军的末日
and will soon see the end of the rebellion.

1477
01:41:26,812 --> 01:41:30,145
全体飞行队员就位
All flight crews, man your stations.

1478
01:41:30,274 --> 01:41:33,144
全体飞行队员就位
All flight crews, man your stations.

1479
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:38,654
你领到你的赏金，你就要走了？
So... you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?

1480
01:41:38,782 --> 01:41:40,240
是的
That's right. Yeah.

1481
01:41:40,367 --> 01:41:44,067
我还有债要还
I got some old debts I got to pay off with this stuff.

1482
01:41:44,203 --> 01:41:45,910
就算没有债要还…
And even if I didn't...

1483
01:41:46,038 --> 01:41:48,659
你想我会傻到留下来？
you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1484
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:50,415
为何不跟我们走？
Why don't you come with us?

1485
01:41:50,543 --> 01:41:52,369
你能打仗，我用得上你
You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1486
01:41:52,502 --> 01:41:55,372
好了！ 你何不看看四周？
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?

1487
01:41:55,506 --> 01:41:56,785
你知道即将发生什么事？
You know what's about to happen...

1488
01:41:56,924 --> 01:41:58,203
知道他们要对抗谁？
what they're up against.

1489
01:41:58,342 --> 01:41:59,504
他们用得上你这样的好飞行员
They could use a good pilot like you.

1490
01:41:59,635 --> 01:42:01,093
你这样是背弃他们
You're turning your back on them.

1491
01:42:01,219 --> 01:42:03,590
人死了，赏金有什么用？
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?

1492
01:42:03,721 --> 01:42:05,594
况且攻击帝国军战斗站…
Besides, attacking that battle station...

1493
01:42:05,724 --> 01:42:06,754
并非我认为的勇气之举
ain't my idea of courage.

1494
01:42:06,891 --> 01:42:09,678
我看更像…自杀
It's more like... suicide.

1495
01:42:11,061 --> 01:42:11,974
好吧！
All right.

1496
01:42:12,104 --> 01:42:14,345
保重你自己
Take care of yourself, Han.

1497
01:42:14,482 --> 01:42:17,019
我想那是你最拿手的事，对吧？
I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?

1498
01:42:17,151 --> 01:42:18,479
卢克
Hey, Luke.

1499
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:24,187
愿原力与你同在
May the Force be with you.

1500
01:42:30,663 --> 01:42:31,943
你看个什么劲儿？
What are you looking at?

1501
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:33,872
我知道我在作什么
I know what I'm doing.

1502
01:42:38,295 --> 01:42:41,710
所有飞行员就位
All pilots to your stations.

1503
01:42:41,841 --> 01:42:43,797
所有飞行员就位
All pilots to your stations.

1504
01:42:49,055 --> 01:42:50,465
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1505
01:42:50,599 --> 01:42:52,092
是汉！
Oh, it's Han.

1506
01:42:52,225 --> 01:42:54,431
我不知道，我以为他改变主意了
I don't know. I really thought he'd change his mind.

1507
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,137
他必须走他自己的路
He's got to follow his own path.

1508
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:58,096
别人没办法替他选择
No one can choose it for him.

1509
01:42:58,231 --> 01:43:02,310
我真希望本也在这儿
I only wish Ben were here.

要我准备好你的宇宙飞船吗？
Should I have your ship standing by?

1649
01:51:16,737 --> 01:51:19,606
在我们胜利的时刻撤退？
Evacuate in our moment of triumph?

1650
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:21,447
我看你高估他们的机会了
I think you overestimate their chances.

1651
01:51:21,575 --> 01:51:24,243
叛军基地 3 分钟，接近中

1652
01:51:24,369 --> 01:51:26,823

1656
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:34,294
红色队长，这里是一号基地

1657
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:35,878
保留一半人马…
Keep half your group out of range...

1658
01:51:36,005 --> 01:51:37,284
准备展开下一波行动
for the next run.

1659
01:51:37,423 --> 01:51:39,794
知道了，一号基地卢克，红色 2 号及 3 号
Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three.

01:51:39,925 --> 01:51:43,210
在这儿等我的讯号展开你们的行动
Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run.

1661
01:51:51,061 --> 01:51:52,851
这就是了！
This is it!

1662
01:51:57,442 --> 01:51:59,517
我们现在应该已经看到
We should be able to see it by now.

1663
01:52:01,236 --> 01:52:02,979
注意那些战斗机
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1664
01:52:04,698 --> 01:52:05,978
太多干扰
There's too much interference.

1665
01:52:06,116 --> 01:52:07,195
红色 5 号，你能看到敌军战斗机吗？
Red Five, can you see them from where you are?

1666
01:52:07,326 --> 01:52:09,199
什么也没看… 慢着！3点5分方向
No sign of any... Wait. Coming in.35.

1667
01:52:09,328 --> 01:52:10,276
我看到了

1668
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:12,908
进入射程
I'm in range.

1669
01:52:14,207 --> 01:52:15,155
目标快要到了
Target's coming up.

1670
01:52:18,503 --> 01:52:20,625
只要挡住他们几秒钟
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1671
01:52:20,755 --> 01:52:23,042
排成对形
Close up formation.

1672
01:52:24,425 --> 01:52:26,583
快到了
Almost there.

1673
01:52:35,686 --> 01:52:37,594
我摆脱不掉他们，他们就在我后面
You'd better let her loose. They're right behind me.

1674
01:52:37,812 --> 01:52:38,926
就快到了
Almost there.

1675
01:52:40,356 --> 01:52:41,980
我挡不住他们
I can't hold them.

1676
01:52:50,241 --> 01:52:51,699
发射了！
It's away!

1677
01:52:55,537 --> 01:52:57,030
击中了吗？
It's a hit!

1678
01:52:57,164 --> 01:52:59,202
没中！ 没中！ 没进去
Negative, negative. It didn't go in.

1679
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:01,953
只在表面爆炸
It just impacted on the surface.

1680
01:53:08,508 --> 01:53:10,084
红色队长，我们就在你上面
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1681
01:53:10,218 --> 01:53:12,506
转向05 方向，我会掩护你
Turn to.05. We'll cover for you.

1682
01:53:12,637 --> 01:53:16,088
我刚损失右舷引擎
Stay there. I just lost my starboard engine.

1683
01:53:16,223 --> 01:53:18,464
展开你的攻击行动
Get set up for your attack run.

1684
01:53:31,279 --> 01:53:34,398
叛军基地，一分钟，继续接近
Rebel base, one minute and closing.

1685
01:53:34,532 --> 01:53:36,737
毕格斯，威治，我们向目标接近
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1686
01:53:36,868 --> 01:53:38,658
我们要全力冲进去
We're going in full throttle.

1687
01:53:38,786 --> 01:53:40,161
你替我挡住那些战斗机
That ought to keep those fighters off our back.

1688
01:53:40,371 --> 01:53:42,363
紧跟着你
Right with you, boss.

1689
01:53:42,497 --> 01:53:44,738
你的速度能及时击中吗？
Luke, at that speed, will you be able to pull out in time?

1690
01:53:44,875 --> 01:53:46,867
没问题，顺顺利利地
It'll be just like Beggars Canyon back home.

1691
01:53:54,217 --> 01:53:56,422
我们在你后面，掩护你
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1692
01:53:56,553 --> 01:53:57,583
我看得到塔…
My scope shows the tower...

1693
01:53:57,721 --> 01:53:59,095
但看不到排气口
but I can't see the exhaust port.

1694
01:53:59,221 --> 01:54:00,679
你确信电脑能击中吗？
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1695
01:54:04,143 --> 01:54:06,135
你自己要小心，要加速前速
Watch yourself. Increase speed, full throttle.

1696
01:54:06,270 --> 01:54:07,514
炮塔呢？
What about that tower?

1697
01:54:07,647 --> 01:54:08,760
你管敌机！
You worry about those fighters!

1698
01:54:08,897 --> 01:54:10,059
我来管炮塔！
I'll worry about the tower!

1699
01:54:15,696 --> 01:54:18,649
R2，稳定器又松了
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again.

1700
01:54:18,781 --> 01:54:20,061
你把它固定好吗？
See if you can't lock it down.

1701
01:54:28,791 --> 01:54:30,996
敌机来了，３点方向
Fighters coming in.3.

1702
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:41,457
我被击中，我不能跟你了
I'm hit! I can't stay with you!

1703
01:54:41,595 --> 01:54:43,919
退开，威治 你在后面也帮不了忙
Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there.

1704
01:54:44,056 --> 01:54:45,004
抱歉！
Sorry.

1705
01:54:46,265 --> 01:54:48,008
让他走！ 跟着领队战斗机
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1706
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:52,478
快点！ 卢克，这次他们速度更快
Hurry, Luke. They're coming in much faster this time.

1707
01:54:52,605 --> 01:54:53,767
我们挡不住他们
We can't hold them.

1708
01:54:57,401 --> 01:54:58,728
R2，加速！
R2, try and increase the power.

1709
01:55:05,492 --> 01:55:06,653
快点！ 卢克！
Hurry up, Luke!

1710
01:55:06,785 --> 01:55:08,278
快点！快点！
Quick! Quick!

1711
01:55:15,835 --> 01:55:18,325
叛军基地，30 秒，继续接近
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.

1712
01:55:18,462 --> 01:55:19,541
我来对付领队
I'm on the leader.

1713
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:24,424
支持下去！ R2
Hang on, R2.

1714
01:55:39,982 --> 01:55:42,270
使用宇宙之原力，卢克
Use the Force, Luke.

1715
01:55:45,154 --> 01:55:47,146
放手去作！
Let go, Luke.

1716
01:55:49,282 --> 01:55:51,570
这架原力很强烈
The Force is strong with this one.

1717
01:55:51,701 --> 01:55:53,278
卢克！ 相信我

1718
01:55:58,833 --> 01:56:00,160
他的电脑关掉了
His computer's off.

1719
01:56:00,293 --> 01:56:02,166
卢克！ 你关掉瞄准的电脑！
Luke, you switched off your targeting computer!

1720
01:56:02,295 --> 01:56:03,871
怎么回事？
What's wrong?

1721
01:56:04,005 --> 01:56:05,628
没事！ 我很好
Nothing. I'm all right.

1722
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,757
我损失了R2！
I've lost R2!

1723
01:56:21,354 --> 01:56:24,189
星球受到威胁
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1724
01:56:24,316 --> 01:56:27,102
星球受到威胁
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1725
01:56:27,234 --> 01:56:28,858
叛军基地在射程内

1726

1727

1728

1729
01:56:50,882 --> 01:56:51,960

百里挑一

1738
01:57:54,775 --> 01:57:56,233

1739
01:58:00,196 --> 01:58:01,571

1740
01:58:01,698 --> 01:58:03,440
我就知道你会回来！ 我就知道
I knew you'd come back. I just knew it.

1741
01:58:03,575 --> 01:58:04,854
我才不让你独享功劳…
Well, I wasn't going to let you get all the credit...

1742
01:58:04,992 --> 01:58:06,271
拿走所有赏金
and take all the reward.

1743
01:58:06,410 --> 01:58:08,947
我就知道你不是只看重钱
Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.

1744
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:10,241
糟了！

1745
01:58:10,373 --> 01:58:12,779
