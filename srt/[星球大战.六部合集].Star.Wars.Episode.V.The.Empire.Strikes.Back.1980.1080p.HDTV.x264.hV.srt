1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
卢卡斯电影
{\fs14}

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,700
很久以前，在遥远的银河系…
{\fs14}

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,100
星球大战
{\fs14}

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,300
帝国大反击
{\fs14}

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,900
反抗军处于黑暗时期
{\fs14}

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,300
帝国的死星战斗基地被毁
{\fs14}

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,900
但反抗军也因秘密基地曝光
{\fs14}

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,400
而四处逃窜
{\fs14}

9
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,100
一群自由斗士
{\fs14}

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,800
在卢克天行者领导下
{\fs14}

11
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,000
建立了新的秘密基地
{\fs14}

12
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,800
地点在冰冷遥远的霍斯星
{\fs14}

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,800
为追捕卢克天行者
{\fs14}

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,700
邪恶的黑武士达斯维达派出无数爪牙
{\fs14}

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,600
遍寻银河每个角落…
{\fs14}

16
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:25,077
回音三号呼叫七号
{\fs14}Echo Three to Echo Seven.

17
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,116
老韩，听到没？
{\fs14}Han, old buddy, do you read me?

18
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:29,201
清楚得很，干嘛？
{\fs14}Loud and clear, kid. What's up?

19
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:31,885
我兜了一圈,没发现生物迹象
{\fs14}I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.

20
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,803
冰天雪地会有什么生物？
{\fs14}There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser.

21
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:36,643
感应器装好了，我走了
{\fs14}The sensors are placed. I'm going back.

22
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:38,562
好，等会见
{\fs14}Right. I'll see you shortly.

23
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,676
这一带有陨石坠落
{\fs14}There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here.

24
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,921
我看看，马上就好
{\fs14}I want to check it out. It won't take long.

25
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:44,034
稳住
{\fs14}Steady.

26
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:48,522
稳住，怎么啦？有东西？
{\fs14}Steady, girl. What's the matter? You smell something?

27
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:29,757
阿秋，阿秋
{\fs14}Chewie. Chewie?

28
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:37,640
别发脾气
{\fs14}All right. Don't lose your temper.

29
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,074
我马上来帮你
{\fs14}I'll come right back and give you a hand.

30
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:00,834
苏洛
{\fs14}Solo.

31
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:03,604
没发现生命迹象，将军。感应器装好了
{\fs14}No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.

32
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:06,398
- 有动静你会知道   - 天行者回来没有？
{\fs14}- You'll know if anything comes around. - Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

33
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:09,198
没有，他去看陨石
{\fs14}No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.

34
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:12,681
这一带陨石太多，敌舰入侵很难发现
{\fs14}With all the meteor activity, it's gonna be difficult to spot approaching ships.

35
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,636
我得走了，不能再待了
{\fs14}General, I gotta leave. I can't stay any more.

36
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:17,484
- 很遗憾   - 贾霸悬赏抓我
{\fs14}- I'm sorry to hear that. - There's a price on my head.

37
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:19,835
再不拿钱给他，就死定了
{\fs14}If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a dead man.

38
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:21,717
有这个阴影确实不好
{\fs14}A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.

39
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,633
你是个勇士，很不舍得你走
{\fs14}You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.

40
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:27,118
谢谢你，将军
{\fs14}Thank you, General.

41
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,802
公主殿下，就此别过
{\fs14}Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.

42
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:38,714
好
{\fs14}That's right.

43
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:43,760
别太难过，再会了，殿下
{\fs14}Don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.

44
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:47,794
老韩！
{\fs14}Han.

45
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:52,477
- 什么事，殿下？   - 你不是要留下吗？
{\fs14}- Yes, Your Highnessness. - I thought you had decided to stay.

46
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:55,324
到处有赏金猎人在找我，我不得不走
{\fs14}The bounty hunter we ran into in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

47
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,595
我们需要你
{\fs14}Han, we need you.

48
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,716
- “我们”？  - 对
{\fs14}- We need? - Yes.

49
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:02,200
- 不是“”需要？   - 我？
{\fs14}- What about you need? - I need?

50
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:04,680
我不明白
{\fs14}I don't know what you're talking about.

51
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:08,161
- 我想也是   - 我应该明白什么？
{\fs14}- You probably don't. - What precisely am I supposed to know?

52
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,595
别装了，对我有感觉，才要我留下来
{\fs14}Come on. You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.

53
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:14,193
对，你是个好帮手，有领导才干
{\fs14}Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader.

54
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:16,759
不对！ 不是那个
{\fs14}No. That's not it.

55
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,443
来啊…
{\fs14}Come on.

56
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,596
- 招了吧   - 你在胡思乱想
{\fs14}- Come on. - You're imagining things.

57
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:23,556
是吗？那跟来干嘛？
{\fs14}Am I? Then why are you following me?

58
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,801
怕我不跟吻别？
{\fs14}Afraid I'd leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?

59
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:28,393
- 还不如去亲武技兽   - 我来安排
{\fs14}- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee. - I can arrange that.

60
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,561
你需要好好亲一下
{\fs14}You could use a good kiss!

61
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,159
怎么能怪我？又没叫你开电热器
{\fs14}Don't blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater.

62
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:37,561
我只说公主房间很冷
{\fs14}I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber.

63
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:39,437
但本来就该那样
{\fs14}It's supposed to be freezing.

64
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,874
她衣服都湿了，怎么办？
{\fs14}How we're going to dry her clothes I really don't know.

65
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,154
够了！
{\fs14}Oh, switch off!

66
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:46,243
现在拆开干嘛？都要走了！
{\fs14}Why did you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here.

67
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,401
- 对不起…   - 装回去！
{\fs14}- Excuse me. - Put them back together right now.

68
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,481
- 有事跟您说   - 什么事？
{\fs14}- Might I have a word? - What do you want?

69
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:52,994
是莉亚公主，她想跟你通话
{\fs14}Princess Leia's been trying to get you on the communicator.

70
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,195
我对讲机关了，不想跟她讲话
{\fs14}I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.

71
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:58,078
公主担心卢克主人，他没回来
{\fs14}Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

72
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,355
- 也不知道在哪   - 我也不知道
{\fs14}- She doesn't know where he is. - I don't know where he is.

73
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:03,158
- 没有人知道   - 怎么说没人知道？
{\fs14}- Nobody knows where he is. - What do you mean, nobody knows?

74
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:04,513
值日官！
{\fs14}Deck Officer.

75
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:07,034
- 值日官！   - 对不起
{\fs14}- Deck Officer. - Excuse me, sir. Might I-

76
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,837
天行者在哪里？
{\fs14}Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?

77
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,525
没看见，有可能从南入口进来
{\fs14}I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in the south entrance.

78
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,761
有可能？打听一下好吗？
{\fs14}It's possible? Why don't you go find out?

79
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:16,319
- 天快黑了   - 是
{\fs14}- It's getting dark out there. - Yes, sir.

80
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:18,720
能不能请问怎么回事？
{\fs14}Excuse me, sir. Might I enquire what's going on?

81
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,040
- 要问就问   - 不可理喻
{\fs14}- Why not? - Impossible man.

82
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,076
走，R2，去找莉亚公主
{\fs14}Come along, R2. Let's find Princess Leia.

83
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:26,117
别跟人家说，我觉得主人出事了
{\fs14}Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

84
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,435
天行者没从南入口回来
{\fs14}Commander Skywalker hasn't come in the south entrance.

85
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,920
- 有可能忘了报到   - 不会，气垫车好了吗？
{\fs14}- Maybe he forgot to check in. - Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

86
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,036
改装还没完成
{\fs14}Not yet. We're having trouble adapting them to the cold.

87
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:44,998
- 那就骑咚咚兽   - 气温降得太快了
{\fs14}- We'll have to go out on tauntauns. - The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

88
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,081
而我的朋友还在外面
{\fs14}That's right, and my friend's out in it.

89
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:54,040
它没一会就会冻毙
{\fs14}Your tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker.

90
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,121
那就地狱再见
{\fs14}Then I'll see you in hell.

91
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,122
进去吧，R2
{\fs14}You must come along now, R2.

92
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,201
这样不是办法
{\fs14}There's really nothing more we can do.

93
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,316
我的关节快冻僵了
{\fs14}And my joints are freezing up.

94
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:19,119
别说傻话，少爷当然会回来
{\fs14}Don't say things like that. Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

95
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:21,884
他一定会平安无恙
{\fs14}And he'll be quite all right. You'll see.

96
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:25,475
真会胡思乱想，他一定会平安无恙
{\fs14}Stupid little short circuit. He'll be quite all right.

97
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,444
巡逻队都回来了，还是…
{\fs14}Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no-

98
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:27,364
还是没有发现
{\fs14}Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

99
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:31,398
莉亚公主，R2收不到任何信号
{\fs14}Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals...

100
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,756
但有可能是距离的关系
{\fs14}although he admits that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.

101
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,921
殿下，今晚是没办法了
{\fs14}Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight.

102
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:39,275
门屏必须关闭
{\fs14}The shield doors must be closed.

103
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,874
- 把门关上   - 是
{\fs14}- Close the doors. - Yes, sir.

104
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:48,876
R2说生还的希望是725比1
{\fs14}R2 says the chances of survival are 725-to-1.

105
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:03,554
其实，R2也曾失算
{\fs14}Actually, R2 has been known to make mistakes...

106
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:08,076
有的时候
{\fs14}from time to time.

107
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,957
真是的…
{\fs14}Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

108
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,319
别担心卢克主人，他一定会平安的
{\fs14}Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right.

109
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:18,118
以人的标准来说，他算聪明的
{\fs14}He's quite clever, you know, for a human being.

110
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,197
卢克…
{\fs14}Luke.

111
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,239
卢克
{\fs14}Luke.

112
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:46,924
班？
{\fs14}Ben?

113
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:49,559
去达可巴星系
{\fs14}You will go to the Dagobah system.

114
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,357
达可巴星系？
{\fs14}Dagobah system?

115
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:54,795
去那里拜尤达为师
{\fs14}There you will learn from Yoda...

116
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:58,520
他是我的绝地师父
{\fs14}the Jedi master who instructed me.

117
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:19,476
别这样，给我个生命迹象
{\fs14}Don't do this, Luke. Give me a sign here.

118
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,440
- 没什么时间了   - 班…
{\fs14}- Not much time. - Ben.

119
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:51,760
撑着点，老弟
{\fs14}Hang on, kid.

120
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:55,961
达可巴星系，达可巴
{\fs14}Dagobah system. Dagobah.

121
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,677
这味道不好闻
{\fs14}This may smell bad, kid...

122
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,836
尤达…
{\fs14}Yoda.

123
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:05,243
但能让你保暖，我来搭遮棚
{\fs14}but it'll keep you warm till I get the shelter up.

124
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:07,321
--
{\fs14}Ben. Dagobah.

125
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:12,996
我以为这东西…
{\fs14}I thought they smelled bad...

126
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,877
只是表皮臭
{\fs14}on the outside.

127
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,754
回音基地，收到信号了
{\fs14}Echo Base, I've got something.

128
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:00,716
很微弱，但可能是生物
{\fs14}Not much, but it could be a life form.

129
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,315
天行者，听得见吗？
{\fs14}Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

130
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:09,242
这是野象二号
{\fs14}This is Rogue Two.

131
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,925
这是野象二号
{\fs14}This is Rogue Two.

132
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,764
苏洛舰长，听得见吗？
{\fs14}Captain Solo, do you copy?

133
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:23,555
天行者，听见没有？
{\fs14}Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

134
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,437
这是野象二号
{\fs14}This is Rogue Two.

135
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:28,523
早安，谢谢来看我们
{\fs14}Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.

136
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,357
回音基地，这是野象二号
{\fs14}Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

137
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,953
人找到了，再说一次，人找到了
{\fs14}I've found them. Repeat. I've found them.

138
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:07,521
主人，看你复元真高兴
{\fs14}Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again.

139
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:10,239
- 谢谢，3PO   - R2也松了一口气
{\fs14}- Thanks, 3PO. - R2 expresses his relief also.

140
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:13,721
怎么样？看样子还可以
{\fs14}How ya feelin', kid? You don't look so bad to me.

141
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:16,598
看来健康得不得了
{\fs14}You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.

142
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,354
- 多亏你救了我   - 这是第二次了
{\fs14}- Thanks to you. - That's two you owe me, junior.

143
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:21,759
圣上
{\fs14}Well, Your Worship...

144
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:24,843
看样子我被留住了
{\fs14}looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.

145
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,762
这跟我没关系
{\fs14}I had nothing to do with it.

146
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,399
赖将军说要等防护罩建构完成
{\fs14}General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

147
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,356
才好让船舰离开
{\fs14}until we've activated the energy field.

148
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:32,679
这理由不错
{\fs14}That's a good story.

149
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:36,559
我想就是舍不得我
{\fs14}I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

150
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:39,836
你想象力可真丰富
{\fs14}I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.

151
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:45,281
你笑嘛，大毛球
{\fs14}Laugh it up, fuzzball...

152
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,363
你没看见我们在通道里
{\fs14}but you didn't see us alone in the south passage.

153
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:50,635
她对我表露真情
{\fs14}She expressed her true feelings for me.

154
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:51,834
什么？
{\fs14}My-

155
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:55,241
你这个傲慢、愚昧…
{\fs14}Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

156
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:57,321
邋遢的野人！
{\fs14}scruffy-looking nerf herder!

157
00:16:58,565 --> 00:17:00,362
说谁邋遢？
{\fs14}Who's scruffy-lookin'?

158
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,836
她一定是心事被我说中了
{\fs14}I must have hit close to the mark to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

159
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,158
我看你不很了解女人
{\fs14}I guess you don't know everything about women yet.

160
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:21,725
总部人员，向指挥中心报到
{\fs14}Headquarters personnel, report to command centre.

161
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:27,363
总部人员，向指挥中心报到
{\fs14}Headquarters personnel, report to command centre.

162
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:29,362
保重
{\fs14}Take it easy.

163
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,441
失陪
{\fs14}Excuse us, please.

164
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,601
公主，有不速之客
{\fs14}Princess, we have a visitor.

165
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:39,478
在基地外，十二区往东移动
{\fs14}We picked up something outside Zone 12 moving east.

166
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,755
- 是金属品   - 那就不是那些怪兽
{\fs14}- It's metal. - It couldn't be one of those creatures.

167
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:45,514
- 可能是我们的气垫船   - 不对…等一下
{\fs14}- Could be one of our speeders. - No. Wait.

168
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:48,159
有个微弱信号
{\fs14}There's something very weak coming through.

169
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:54,277
我懂六百万种通讯方式
{\fs14}Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication.

170
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:57,397
反抗军不用这讯号，可能是帝国的通讯
{\fs14}This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an imperial code.

171
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,121
总之是敌非友，阿秋，去看看
{\fs14}It isn't friendly. Chewie, let's check it out.

172
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:08,123
派野象十、十一号查看，飞行员到三十八号棚报到
{\fs14}Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

173
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:44,801
- 已经支离破碎   - 是什么东西？
{\fs14}- I'm afraid there's not much left. - What was it?

174
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,881
一种机器人，我只开了一枪
{\fs14}Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard.

175
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:50,315
- 一定是有自爆装置   - 帝国的侦查机器人
{\fs14}- Must have had a self-destruct. - An imperial probe droid.

176
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,198
八成被他们发现了
{\fs14}It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.

177
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,445
我们最好快撤离
{\fs14}We'd better start the evacuation.

178
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,994
- 将军   - 什么事，舰长？
{\fs14}- Admiral. - Yes, Captain?

179
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:45,118
好像有发现了。派去霍斯星系的机器人
{\fs14}I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment...

180
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:47,998
提供了一点线索
{\fs14}from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.

181
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,083
派出的机器人有几千个
{\fs14}We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy.

182
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:54,038
- 我要证据，不要线索   - 有生物的迹象
{\fs14}- I want proof, not leads. - The visuals indicate life readings.

183
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:56,315
生物可多着呢，如果每个都追…
{\fs14}It could mean anything. If we followed up every lead-

184
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,357
霍斯星系 应无人烟
{\fs14}But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of humans forms.

185
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,755
- 有发现吗？   - 是，勋爵
{\fs14}- You found something? - Yes, my lord.

186
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,320
没错，叛党在那里
{\fs14}That's it. The rebels are there.

187
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:10,715
图上没有的聚落太多了
{\fs14}My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements.

188
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:13,484
- 可能是走私客…   - 就是那个星系
{\fs14}- It could be smugglers- - That is the system.

189
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:15,880
我相信天行者也在那里
{\fs14}And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

190
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:18,883
飞往霍斯星系
{\fs14}Set your course for the Hoth system.

191
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:21,314
韦将军，叫部属准备
{\fs14}General Veers, prepare your men.

192
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:22,719
将军
{\fs14}Admiral.

193
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:31,241
七组和十组飞气垫船
{\fs14}Groups Seven and 10 will stay behind to fly the speeders.

194
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,117
每艘运输舰一装满
{\fs14}As soon as each transport is loaded...

195
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,201
管制台就会下令起飞
{\fs14}evacuation control will give clearance for launch.

196
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:36,917
是
{\fs14}Right, sir.

197
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,961
行了
{\fs14}All right. That's it.

198
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:42,438
试试看
{\fs14}Try it.

199
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:46,759
快关掉！关掉！
{\fs14}Turn it off! Turn it off!

200
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:52,316
T47撤离需要很久
{\fs14}Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-47 s.

201
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:55,915
重装备就算了，小型设备装运时间很多
{\fs14}Forget the heavy equipment. There's time to get small modules on the transports.

202
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:58,001
- 保重   - 谢谢
{\fs14}- Take care, sir. - Thanks.

203
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:04,277
阿秋，你多保重
{\fs14}Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

204
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:09,443
--
{\fs14}Okay, okay.

205
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:12,244
老弟
{\fs14}Hi, kid.

206
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:15,323
一定有原因，另一边看看
{\fs14}There's gotta be a reason for it. Check it at the other end.

207
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:16,798
等一下
{\fs14}Wait a second.

208
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,154
- 你还好吧？   - 还好
{\fs14}- Are you all right? - Yeah.

209
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,195
小心
{\fs14}Be careful.

210
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:30,077
你也是
{\fs14}You too.

211
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:37,762
将军，星际驱逐舰队
{\fs14}General, there's a fleet of Stardestroyers...

212
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:40,035
刚脱离超太空
{\fs14}coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

213
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,998
所有电力转到防护罩
{\fs14}Reroute all power to the energy shield.

214
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,083
要让运输舰安然离开
{\fs14}We gotta hold them till all transports are away.

215
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,161
准备地面作战
{\fs14}Prepare for ground assault.

216
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:04,682
- 什么事，将军？   - 舰队停止了光速飞行
{\fs14}- What is it, General? - The fleet has moved out of light speed.

217
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:06,796
霍斯星系第六星球…
{\fs14}ComScan has detected an energy field...

218
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,393
有个地区受强大防护罩保护
{\fs14}protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system.

219
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,880
足以抵抗任何轰炸
{\fs14}The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.

220
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:14,360
叛军知道我们到了
{\fs14}The rebels are alerted to our presence.

221
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:17,443
欧将军早该停止光速飞行
{\fs14}Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed too close to the system.

222
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:19,715
他想施行突击…
{\fs14}He felt surprise was wiser.

223
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,836
他既笨拙又愚蠢
{\fs14}He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

224
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,401
将军，准备地面攻击
{\fs14}General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.

225
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:27,083
是
{\fs14}Yes, my lord.

226
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,834
维达勋爵
{\fs14}Lord Vader.

227
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,843
我们已停止光速飞行…
{\fs14}The fleet has moved out of light speed, and we're preparing to-

228
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:42,844
这是你最后一次犯错
{\fs14}You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.

229
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:45,240
- 皮舰长   - 是
{\fs14}- Captain Piett. - Yes, my lord?

230
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,243
让部队在防护罩外登陆
{\fs14}Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field...

231
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:51,198
别让叛党离开这个星系
{\fs14}and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off the system.

232
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:54,362
现在由你指挥，皮将军
{\fs14}You are in command now, Admiral Piett.

233
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:56,237
谢谢，维达勋爵
{\fs14}Thank you, Lord Vader.

234
00:22:57,765 --> 00:23:00,723
运兵舰在北门集合
{\fs14}All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance.

235
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:03,405
大型运输舰装满就出发
{\fs14}The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded.

236
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:05,481
每艘由两架战机护航
{\fs14}Only two fighter escorts per ship.

237
00:23:05,605 --> 00:23:08,563
防护罩开启时间有限
{\fs14}The energy shield can only be opened for a short time...

238
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:11,074
你们要紧跟着运输舰
{\fs14}so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.

239
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:13,196
两架对一艘驱逐舰？
{\fs14}Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

240
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,281
离子炮会不时发射
{\fs14}The ion cannon will fire several shots...

241
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:18,397
使敌舰远离你们航道
{\fs14}to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path.

242
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,516
离开防护罩后
{\fs14}When you've gotten past the energy shield...

243
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:22,601
直接前往会合点
{\fs14}proceed directly to the rendezvous point.

244
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:24,556
明白？
{\fs14}Understood?

245
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,198
祝好运
{\fs14}Good luck.

246
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:28,680
各就各位，走吧
{\fs14}Everybody to your stations. Let's go.

247
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:48,083
他们会先破坏发电机
{\fs14}Their primary target will be the power generators.

248
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:49,957
准备开启防护罩
{\fs14}Prepare to open shield.

249
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:57,635
长官，叛军舰艇接近了
{\fs14}Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.

250
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,756
好，第一批客人上门
{\fs14}Good. Our first catch of the day.

251
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:03,681
离子炮准备
{\fs14}Stand by, ion control.

252
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:05,680
发射
{\fs14}Fire.

253
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,237
第一艘运输舰安全了
{\fs14}The first transport is away.

254
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:26,004
第一艘运输舰安全了
{\fs14}The first transport is away.

255
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:34,042
觉得怎么样？
{\fs14}Feeling all right, sir?

256
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:35,962
好得很，戴克，你呢？
{\fs14}Just like new, Dak. How about you?

257
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:38,883
我感觉勇气十足
{\fs14}Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.

258
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,961
我了解
{\fs14}I know what you mean.

259
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:01,716
-3T8回音站，发现帝国装甲走兽
{\fs14}Echo Station 3-T8. We've spotted imperial walkers.

260
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:04,200
北脊有装甲走兽
{\fs14}Imperial walkers on the north ridge.

261
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:27,600
-57回音站，我们来了
{\fs14}Echo Station 57, we're on our way.

262
00:25:32,805 --> 00:25:34,716
大家靠近点
{\fs14}All right, boys, keep tight now.

263
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:36,881
卢克，我的攻击路径没设好
{\fs14}Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.

264
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:38,404
慢慢来，戴克
{\fs14}Steady, Dak.

265
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:40,277
三角攻击队形，开始
{\fs14}Attack pattern Delta. Go now.

266
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:45,483
好，我来了
{\fs14}I'm coming in.

267
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:50,834
郝碧，你没问题吧？
{\fs14}Hobbie, you still with me?

268
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,681
装甲太厚了
{\fs14}That armour's too strong for blasters.

269
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,115
发射绳钩，把它们绊倒
{\fs14}Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables.

270
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,315
钩它们的腿，可能只有这办法
{\fs14}Go for the legs. It might be our only chance.

271
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:24,799
准备，戴克
{\fs14}Stand by, Dak.

272
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:27,598
卢克，射控出了问题
{\fs14}Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control.

273
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:29,636
要用辅助系统
{\fs14}I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

274
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,562
撑一下
{\fs14}Just hang on.

275
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:34,358
等一下，戴克。准备发射绳钩
{\fs14}Hang on, Dak. Get ready to fire that tow cable.

276
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,475
戴克
{\fs14}Dak?

277
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:06,443
维达勋爵，我已接近主发电机
{\fs14}Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generators.

278
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:09,523
防护罩即将关闭，可以开始登陆
{\fs14}The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing.

279
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:15,440
野象三号
{\fs14}Rogue Three.

280
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:16,918
听到了，领队
{\fs14}Copy, Rogue Leader.

281
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:19,878
魏吉，我的炮手阵亡了 你来射这一枪
{\fs14}Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot.

282
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,643
我帮你掩护
{\fs14}I'll cover for you.

283
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,995
准备绳钩，跟我飞过去
{\fs14}Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.

284
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:27,036
我过来了，领队
{\fs14}Coming around, Rogue Leader.

285
00:27:29,805 --> 00:27:31,204
稳住，野象二号
{\fs14}Steady, Rogue Two.

286
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:33,154
发射绳钩
{\fs14}Activate harpoon.

287
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:37,478
射得好，詹生
{\fs14}Good shot,Janson.

288
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,480
再绕一次，来了
{\fs14}One more pass.

289
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:52,995
缆绳出尽，让它去吧
{\fs14}Cable out. Let her go!

290
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,274
放掉缆绳
{\fs14}Detach cable.

291
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,074
放掉了
{\fs14}Cable detached.

292
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:05,203
快！
{\fs14}Come on!

293
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,193
- 这下倒了   - 我看到了，魏吉，做得好
{\fs14}- That got him! - I see it, Wedge. Good work.

294
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,681
没法一次保护两艘运输舰
{\fs14}I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.

295
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:20,000
时间所剩不多
{\fs14}It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer.

296
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,683
只能这么办
{\fs14}We have no choice.

297
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:25,165
- 巡逻艇出发   - 撤离剩余人员
{\fs14}- Launch patrol. - Evacuate remaining ground staff.

298
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:33,235
这个装那里 那个装那里，懂吗？
{\fs14}This one goes there, that one goes there. Right?

299
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:36,675
R2，好好照顾主人，听到没？
{\fs14}R2, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?

300
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:40,481
也要照顾自己
{\fs14}And do take good care of yourself.

301
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:45,478
唉，真是的
{\fs14}Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

302
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:10,555
部队全部登陆攻击
{\fs14}All troops will debark for ground assault.

303
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:13,040
准备射击主发电机
{\fs14}Prepare to target the main generator.

304
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:19,875
- 野象二号，没事吧？   - 没事，我跟着你，领队
{\fs14}- Rogue Two, are you all right? - Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

305
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,757
准备绳钩，我掩护你
{\fs14}Set harpoon. I'll cover for you.

306
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:26,083
- 我来了   - 小心炮火
{\fs14}- Coming around. - Watch that crossfire, boys.

307
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:29,203
设定第三位置
{\fs14}Set for position three.

308
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:30,553
稳着
{\fs14}Steady.

309
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,074
紧跟着低飞
{\fs14}Stay tight and low. This is it!

310
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:39,919
郝碧
{\fs14}Hobbie!

311
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,444
我中弹了
{\fs14}I've been hit!

312
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,005
- 没事吧？   - 怎么还没走？
{\fs14}- You all right? - Why are you still here?

313
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,003
- 我听说指挥中心被击中   - 刚才就叫你走了
{\fs14}- Heard the command centre had been hit. - You've got your clearance to leave.

314
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,401
别担心，我会走。我先送你们上去
{\fs14}Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

315
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:34,483
殿下，只剩这艘运输舰了 这是唯一的希望
{\fs14}Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.

316
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:37,563
派12区的部队到南坡 负责保护战机
{\fs14}Send all troops in Sector 12 to the south slope to protect the fighters.

317
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,121
帝国部队进了基地，
{\fs14}Imperial troops have entered the base.

318
00:30:41,245 --> 00:30:42,803
帝国部队…
{\fs14}Imperial troops have entered-

319
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,722
快走
{\fs14}Come on. That's it.

320
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,075
下达撤退信号
{\fs14}Give the evacuation code signal.

321
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:50,881
快上运输舰
{\fs14}And get to your transports.

322
00:30:51,005 --> 00:30:52,074
等等我…
{\fs14}Wait for me.

323
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:53,604
开始撤退
{\fs14}Begin retreat!

324
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,397
回去！
{\fs14}Fall back!

325
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:54,922
- 发电机距离   - 17.28
{\fs14}- Distance to power generators? - 17.28.

326
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:05,516
瞄准，全部火力
{\fs14}Target. Maximum firepower.

327
00:32:30,805 --> 00:32:33,273
运输舰，我是苏洛，快起飞，我没法过来
{\fs14}Transport, this is Solo. Take off. I can't get to you.

328
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,236
我带公主搭千年鹰号
{\fs14}I'll get her out on the Falcon. Come on.

329
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:39,721
你们去哪里？ 回来！
{\fs14}Where are you going? Come back!

330
00:32:57,485 --> 00:33:00,716
等等我…站住
{\fs14}Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

331
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,597
- 每次都这样！   - 快
{\fs14}- How typical. - Come on.

332
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:09,163
快点，金童子！你要变永久居民了
{\fs14}Hurry up, goldenrod! You're gonna be a permanent resident.

333
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:10,957
等一下…
{\fs14}Wait! Wait!

334
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:31,202
- 怎么啦？  - 要不要我下去推？
{\fs14}- How's this? - Would it help if I got out and pushed?

335
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,441
- 苏洛舰长…   - 会有帮助
{\fs14}- Captain Solo. Captain Solo. - It might.

336
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:37,245
我想跟你说…
{\fs14}Sir, might I suggest that you-

337
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:38,957
等一下好了
{\fs14}It can wait.

338
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:45,434
这艘破船哪能跑得了？
{\fs14}This bucket of bolts will never get past that blockade.

339
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,521
这宝贝有几招还没使呢
{\fs14}This baby's got a few surprises left in her.

340
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,043
快点…
{\fs14}Come on! Come on!

341
00:33:58,165 --> 00:34:00,998
开机，希望不要熄火
{\fs14}Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

342
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:03,596
看吧
{\fs14}See?

343
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,920
你总有一天会出错，我希望能够目睹
{\fs14}Someday you'll be wrong. I hope I'm there to see it.

344
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:09,754
加速！
{\fs14}Punch it!

345
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,080
R2
{\fs14}R2.

346
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:31,641
准备起飞
{\fs14}Get her ready for take-off.

347
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:35,915
祝好运，卢克，在会合点见
{\fs14}Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.

348
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,600
别担心，R2，我们要走了
{\fs14}Don't worry, R2. We're going. We're going.

349
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:56,681
没问题，我在设新的航线
{\fs14}There's nothing wrong, R2. I'm just setting a new course.

350
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:03,998
我们不跟他们会合，要去达可巴星系
{\fs14}We're not gonna regroup with the others. We're going to the Dagobah system.

351
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:07,684
对，R2
{\fs14}Yes, R2.

352
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,318
没关系，暂时还是用手动飞行
{\fs14}That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.

353
00:35:29,365 --> 00:35:31,640
- 我看见了   - 看见什么了？
{\fs14}- I saw 'em! I saw 'em! - Saw what?

354
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:33,835
两艘星际驱逐舰过来了
{\fs14}Stardestroyers, two of'em coming right at us.

355
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,638
- 先生，有件事情…   - 叫它闭嘴，不然就关机
{\fs14}- Sir, might I suggest- - Shut him up or shut him down!

356
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:40,321
检查反射屏
{\fs14}Check the deflector shield.

357
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:44,241
好极了，我们可以摆脱他们
{\fs14}Great. Well, we can still outmanoeuvre them.

358
00:35:48,405 --> 00:35:50,282
采取闪避行动
{\fs14}Take evasive action!

359
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:04,038
- 准备以光速飞行   - 可是…
{\fs14}- Prepare to jump to light speed. - But, sir!

360
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:06,643
他们接近了
{\fs14}They're getting closer.

361
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,801
是吗？ 瞧我的
{\fs14}Oh, yeah? Watch this.

362
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:13,363
瞧什么？
{\fs14}Watch what?

363
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:17,240
- 麻烦大了   ----
{\fs14}- I think we're in trouble. - If I may say so...

364
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:19,720
我刚才就发现启动器坏了
{\fs14}I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.

365
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,803
- 没法用光速飞行   - 麻烦大了
{\fs14}- It's impossible to go to light speed. - We're in trouble.

366
00:36:26,925 --> 00:36:28,119
检查平面辅助仪
{\fs14}Horizontal boosters!

367
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,156
缓冲器
{\fs14}Alluvial dampers.

368
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:37,445
不对，液压扳手给我
{\fs14}That's not it. Bring me the hydrospanner.

369
00:36:40,805 --> 00:36:43,365
这下我也没办法了
{\fs14}I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one.

370
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:47,114
阿秋！
{\fs14}Chewie!

371
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,601
不是雷射炮，被撞到了
{\fs14}That wasn't a laser blast. Something hit us.

372
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:54,078
老韩，快上来
{\fs14}Han, get up here.

373
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:57,118
快，阿秋
{\fs14}Come on, Chewie!

374
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:58,880
小行星群
{\fs14}Asteroids.

375
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:05,153
- 阿秋，定位271   - 你在干嘛？
{\fs14}- Chewie, set 271. - What are you doing?

376
00:37:06,605 --> 00:37:08,721
你要开进小行星群？
{\fs14}You're not actually going into an asteroid field?

377
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,517
那他们就不敢追了，对不对？
{\fs14}They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?

378
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:15,436
不必这样讨好我
{\fs14}You don't have to do this to impress me.

379
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:18,602
成功穿越小行星群的机率
{\fs14}Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field...

380
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:21,842
- 是3700比1   - 别跟我谈机率
{\fs14}- is approximately 3,720-to-1. - Never tell me the odds.

381
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:51,677
说想看我犯错，机会可能来了
{\fs14}You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake. This could be it.

382
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:53,363
我把话收回
{\fs14}I take it back.

383
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:56,443
再不出去会被撞个粉碎
{\fs14}We're gonna get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.

384
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,283
- 这点我同意   - 粉碎？
{\fs14}- Ain't gonna argue with that. - Pulverized?

385
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:00,157
我要去靠近一个大的
{\fs14}I'm going closer to one of the big ones.

386
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:02,037
- 靠近？   - 靠近？
{\fs14}- Closer? - Closer?

387
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:29,842
这等于自杀，无路可走了
{\fs14}This is suicide! There's nowhere to go.

388
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:31,842
那里，看来还可以
{\fs14}There. That looks pretty good.

389
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:33,762
什么看来还可以？
{\fs14}What looks pretty good?

390
00:38:33,885 --> 00:38:36,160
对，很理想
{\fs14}Yeah. That'll do nicely.

391
00:38:36,285 --> 00:38:39,004
对不起，我们去哪里？
{\fs14}Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?

392
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:50,681
希望你有把握
{\fs14}I hope you know what you're doing.

393
00:38:50,805 --> 00:38:52,158
我也希望如此
{\fs14}Yeah. Me too.

394
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,755
对，达可巴星系到了
{\fs14}Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

395
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,241
不，我不会改变主意
{\fs14}No, I'm not gonna change my mind about this.

396
00:39:08,165 --> 00:39:10,520
没有城市或科技的讯号
{\fs14}I'm not picking up any cities or technology.

397
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:12,601
但充满生命迹象
{\fs14}Massive life form readings though.

398
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,601
底下有生物
{\fs14}There's something alive down there.

399
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:19,958
我相信机器人会很安全
{\fs14}Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

400
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,003
--
{\fs14}I know! I know!

401
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,685
我知道观测仪坏了，什么都看不见
{\fs14}All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing.

402
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:34,717
我要准备降落了
{\fs14}Just hang on. I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

403
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:29,159
R2你别动，我来看看
{\fs14}No, R2, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

404
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:34,634
R2？
{\fs14}R2?

405
00:40:38,445 --> 00:40:39,514
你在哪里？
{\fs14}Where are you?

406
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:44,273
R2！
{\fs14}R2!

407
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:52,364
小心一点
{\fs14}You be more careful.

408
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:57,958
R2…那边
{\fs14}R2, that way.

409
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,159
R2！
{\fs14}R2!

410
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:54,118
糟糕…
{\fs14}Oh, no.

411
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:57,281
你没事吧？ 来！
{\fs14}Are you all right? Come on.

412
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,641
还好你不太好吃
{\fs14}You were lucky to get out of there.

413
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:05,563
有没有哪里坏了？
{\fs14}Anything broken?

414
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:11,163
我不得不同意
{\fs14}If you're saying coming here was a bad idea...

415
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:13,355
的确不该来这里
{\fs14}I'm beginning to agree with ya.

416
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:16,045
R2，我们在干嘛？
{\fs14}R2, what are we doing here?

417
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:17,518
好像是…
{\fs14}It's like...

418
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:20,521
梦境的东西
{\fs14}something out of a dream or-

419
00:42:21,445 --> 00:42:23,401
我也不知道
{\fs14}I don't know.

420
00:42:23,525 --> 00:42:25,481
也许我发神经了
{\fs14}Maybe I'm just going crazy.

421
00:42:56,525 --> 00:42:57,844
什么事，将军？
{\fs14}Yes, Admiral?

422
00:42:57,965 --> 00:42:59,956
发现千年鹰了
{\fs14}Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord...

423
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:03,043
但它进了小行星群…
{\fs14}but it has entered an asteroid field, and we cannot risk-

424
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,838
我不管
{\fs14}Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.

425
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:09,355
- 我要逮到他们，不要借口   - 是
{\fs14}- I want that ship, not excuses. - Yes, lord.

426
00:43:15,245 --> 00:43:18,203
只留下紧急供电系统
{\fs14}I'm gonna shut down everything but the emergency power systems.

427
00:43:18,325 --> 00:43:22,113
我很不想问…会不会把我也关了？
{\fs14}Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does that include shutting me down too?

428
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:24,201
我需要你跟计算机沟通
{\fs14}No. I need you to talk to the Falcon...

429
00:43:24,325 --> 00:43:26,475
看超级加速器怎么了
{\fs14}find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.

430
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:37,361
这个小行星可能不稳定
{\fs14}Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.

431
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:39,282
不稳定？
{\fs14}Not entirely stable?

432
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:41,361
你真会叫人安心
{\fs14}I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.

433
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:44,921
阿秋，带这教授到后头检查加速器
{\fs14}Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.

434
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:47,434
我有时真不懂人类
{\fs14}Sometimes I just don't understand human behaviour.

435
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:49,795
我只是尽我的责任
{\fs14}After all, I'm only trying to do my job.

436
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:56,038
放手
{\fs14}Let go.

437
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:00,000
- 请你放手   - 别那么兴奋
{\fs14}- Let go, please. - Don't get excited.

438
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:03,674
这样就能让我兴奋？
{\fs14}Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.

439
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:05,557
抱歉
{\fs14}Sorry, sweetheart.

440
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,245
也没时间做别的
{\fs14}I haven't got time for anything else.

441
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:44,561
要充电了？好
{\fs14}Ready for some power? Okay.

442
00:44:48,405 --> 00:44:49,758
我看看…
{\fs14}Let's see now.

443
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:52,080
这样子…好了
{\fs14}Put that in there. There you go.

444
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:57,724
现在得找尤达
{\fs14}Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...

445
00:44:57,845 --> 00:45:00,040
要是有这号人物
{\fs14}if he even exists.

446
00:45:05,325 --> 00:45:08,123
这里会有绝地大师吗？
{\fs14}It's really a strange place to find a Jedi master.

447
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:11,277
让我毛骨悚然
{\fs14}This place gives me the creeps.

448
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,398
但是…
{\fs14}Still...

449
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:19,556
好像又有点眼熟
{\fs14}there's something familiar about this place.

450
00:45:21,725 --> 00:45:23,443
我也不知道，
{\fs14}I don't know.

451
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:25,521
- 好像…   - 好像什么？
{\fs14}- I feel like- - Feel like what?

452
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:28,123
好像有人在监视
{\fs14}Like we're being watched.

453
00:45:28,245 --> 00:45:31,123
别动武器，我没有恶意
{\fs14}Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.

454
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:34,885
我只是好奇…你来做什么？
{\fs14}I am wondering, why are you here?

455
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,403
- 我来找人   - 找人？
{\fs14}- I'm looking for someone. - Looking?

456
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:42,039
找到人了吧？
{\fs14}Found someone you have, I would say.

457
00:45:43,205 --> 00:45:44,684
对
{\fs14}Right.

458
00:45:45,605 --> 00:45:47,880
我可以帮你
{\fs14}Help you I can. Yes.

459
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:49,874
我看不行
{\fs14}I don't think so.

460
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:54,039
我找一个伟大的战士
{\fs14}I'm looking for a great warrior.

461
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:55,723
伟大的战士？
{\fs14}Great warrior.

462
00:45:58,685 --> 00:46:00,835
战争不会使人伟大
{\fs14}Wars not make one great.

463
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:10,523
别动那个
{\fs14}Put that down.

464
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:12,476
那是我的晚餐
{\fs14}Hey! That's my dinner.

465
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:18,279
你吃这玩意，还长这么大？
{\fs14}How you get so big eating food of this kind?

466
00:46:18,405 --> 00:46:20,521
我们不小心降落在水里
{\fs14}Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle.

467
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:23,079
宇宙飞船出不来…
{\fs14}If we could get our ship out, we would. But we can't.

468
00:46:23,205 --> 00:46:25,196
出不来
{\fs14}Aw, cannot get your ship out.

469
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,917
你快走吧
{\fs14}Get out of there.

470
00:46:30,045 --> 00:46:32,240
不，会被你弄坏
{\fs14}Hey, you could have broken this.

471
00:46:33,805 --> 00:46:35,761
别那样
{\fs14}Don't do that.

472
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:46,441
弄得乱七八糟
{\fs14}You're making a mess.

473
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:49,841
快给我
{\fs14}Hey, give me that.

474
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:52,399
给我，不然不帮你
{\fs14}Mine, or I will help you not.

475
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:54,436
我不要你帮忙，把灯还给我
{\fs14}I don't want your help. I want my lamp back.

476
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:57,204
我要用它来脱离这烂泥坑
{\fs14}I'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mud-hole.

477
00:46:57,325 --> 00:46:59,361
烂泥坑？这是我的家
{\fs14}Mud-hole? Slimy? My home this is.

478
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:04,438
R2，给他算了
{\fs14}R2, let him have it.

479
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:09,639
- 是我的！ 我的！  - R2
{\fs14}- Mine! Mine! Mine! - R2.

480
00:47:13,405 --> 00:47:16,636
走了吧，小家伙，我们忙得很
{\fs14}Will you move along, little fella? We got a lot of work to do.

481
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:20,757
不，我要留下来帮你，帮你找朋友
{\fs14}Stay and help you I will. Find your friend.

482
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,358
我不是找朋友 我找一个绝地大师
{\fs14}I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi master.

483
00:47:26,405 --> 00:47:28,680
绝地大师尤达
{\fs14}Jedi master. Yoda.

484
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,273
- 你要找尤达   - 你认识他？
{\fs14}- You seek Yoda. - You know him?

485
00:47:33,005 --> 00:47:34,961
嗯，我带你去找他
{\fs14}Take you to him I will.

486
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:39,157
对，但先去吃东西，来
{\fs14}Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

487
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:41,845
好吃的，来
{\fs14}Come. Good food. Come.

488
00:47:51,245 --> 00:47:52,803
来啊
{\fs14}Come, come.

489
00:47:54,925 --> 00:47:55,960
R2
{\fs14}R2...

490
00:47:56,805 --> 00:47:58,955
你留着看东西
{\fs14}stay and watch after the camp.

491
00:48:11,965 --> 00:48:13,921
R2死哪去了？
{\fs14}Where is R2 when I need him?

492
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:16,605
您的计算机使用的方言
{\fs14}Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate...

493
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:18,556
我实在有听没懂
{\fs14}but it has the most peculiar dialect.

494
00:48:18,685 --> 00:48:22,041
好像负电轴耦合器坏了
{\fs14}I believe it says the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized.

495
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,520
恐怕要换掉
{\fs14}I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

496
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:27,715
当然要换掉
{\fs14}Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

497
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:31,041
阿秋
{\fs14}Here. And, Chewie...

498
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:35,205
换一个负电轴耦合器
{\fs14}I think we better replace the negative power coupling.

499
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:59,245
圣上，我只是想帮忙
{\fs14}Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.

500
00:48:59,365 --> 00:49:01,720
别那样叫我
{\fs14}Would you please stop calling me that?

501
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:03,722
好啊，莉亚
{\fs14}Sure, Leia.

502
00:49:03,845 --> 00:49:07,121
- 有时你真是难相处   - 一点没错
{\fs14}- You make it so difficult sometimes. - I do. I really do.

503
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:10,315
可以温柔一点
{\fs14}You could be a little nicer though.

504
00:49:10,445 --> 00:49:13,005
有时觉得我还不错
{\fs14}Admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.

505
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,435
有时候…也许
{\fs14}Occasionally, maybe...

506
00:49:17,565 --> 00:49:19,920
如果你不无赖的话
{\fs14}when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

507
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:21,398
无赖？
{\fs14}Scoundrel?

508
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:26,843
这字眼满好听的
{\fs14}I like the sound of that.

509
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:30,558
- 别那样   - 别怎样？
{\fs14}- Stop that. - Stop what?

510
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:32,755
别那样，我的手很脏
{\fs14}Stop that. My hands are dirty.

511
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:34,955
我的手也脏，怕什么？
{\fs14}My hands are dirty too. What are you afraid of?

512
00:49:35,085 --> 00:49:37,121
- 怕？   - 在发抖
{\fs14}- Afraid? - You're trembling.

513
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:40,036
没有
{\fs14}I'm not trembling.

514
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,800
喜欢我无赖
{\fs14}You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

515
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:46,234
难得碰到无赖
{\fs14}There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.

516
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:48,321
我喜欢好人
{\fs14}I happen to like nice men.

517
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:51,005
- 我是个好人   - 你不是
{\fs14}- I'm a nice man. - No, you're not.

518
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:54,760
先生，我…
{\fs14}Sir, sir!

519
00:49:54,885 --> 00:49:57,638
坏掉的耦合器找到了
{\fs14}I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.

520
00:49:59,805 --> 00:50:00,954
谢谢
{\fs14}Thank you.

521
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:03,918
- 真是多谢   - 您千万别客气
{\fs14}- Thank you very much. - You're perfectly welcome, sir.

522
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:12,757
那是他们最后一次出现
{\fs14}That, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes.

523
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,683
我们都这么惨，他们一定活不了
{\fs14}Considering the damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.

524
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,956
不，他们还活着
{\fs14}No, Captain, they're alive.

525
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:23,237
出动所有舰艇，要搜遍小行星群
{\fs14}I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.

526
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:30,756
- 维达勋爵   - 什么事？
{\fs14}- Lord Vader. - Yes, Admiral. What is it?

527
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:33,035
皇上请您跟他联系
{\fs14}The emperor commands you to make contact with him.

528
00:50:33,165 --> 00:50:35,235
到小行星群外头
{\fs14}Move the ship out of the asteroid field...

529
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,515
免得信号受干扰
{\fs14}so that we can send a clear transmission.

530
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:39,203
是
{\fs14}Yes, my lord.

531
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,559
主人有何吩咐？
{\fs14}What is thy bidding, my master?

532
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:02,684
原力有了很大的纷扰
{\fs14}There is a great disturbance in the Force.

533
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:05,755
我也有感觉
{\fs14}I have felt it.

534
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:08,319
我们有个新敌人
{\fs14}We have a new enemy-

535
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:12,279
就是那个摧毁死星的年轻叛军
{\fs14}the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star.

536
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:15,397
我很确定这个男孩
{\fs14}I have no doubt this boy...

537
00:51:15,525 --> 00:51:19,723
是安纳金天行者的后代
{\fs14}is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.

538
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:21,995
这是不可能的
{\fs14}How is that possible?

539
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:25,356
你自己用心想想，黑武士
{\fs14}Search your feelings, Lord Vader.

540
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:28,557
就会知道这千真万确
{\fs14}You will know it to be true.

541
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,040
他能毁掉我们
{\fs14}He could destroy us.

542
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:33,156
他只是个孩子
{\fs14}He's just a boy.

543
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:35,640
欧比王已帮不了他
{\fs14}Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

544
00:51:35,765 --> 00:51:39,201
他的原力很强
{\fs14}The Force is strong with him.

545
00:51:40,525 --> 00:51:45,235
不能让他成为绝地武士
{\fs14}The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.

546
00:51:45,365 --> 00:51:47,435
他能投效
{\fs14}If he could be turned...

547
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:50,284
帝国就好了
{\fs14}he would become a powerful ally.

548
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:52,923
是啊
{\fs14}Yes.

549
00:51:53,765 --> 00:51:57,838
我们会如虎添翼
{\fs14}He would be a great asset.

550
00:51:57,965 --> 00:52:00,115
能不能办到？
{\fs14}Can it be done?

551
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:04,033
他不投效，就死路一条
{\fs14}He will join us or die, master.

552
00:52:20,005 --> 00:52:23,759
我相信很好吃，但为何不能先见尤达？
{\fs14}I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.

553
00:52:23,885 --> 00:52:27,514
要有耐心，绝地武士也该吃饭
{\fs14}Patience. For the Jedi, it is time to eat as well.

554
00:52:30,805 --> 00:52:32,682
吃啊
{\fs14}Eat. Eat.

555
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,799
烫！
{\fs14}Hot.

556
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:44,122
好吃吧？
{\fs14}Good food. Good.

557
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:47,043
尤达住多远？去那里要很久吗？
{\fs14}How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?

558
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:49,315
不远，尤达不远
{\fs14}Not far. Yoda not far.

559
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:52,084
耐心，很快就见面了
{\fs14}Patience. Soon you will be with him.

560
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,965
根叶菜，我煮的
{\fs14}Root leaf. I cook.

561
00:52:58,725 --> 00:53:01,080
你为何想当武士？
{\fs14}Why wish you become Jedi?

562
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,685
主要受我父亲影响
{\fs14}Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

563
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:07,763
啊，父亲…他非常厉害
{\fs14}Father. Powerful Jedi was he.

564
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:10,877
- 很厉害的武士   - 算了吧
{\fs14}- Powerful Jedi. - Oh, come on.

565
00:53:11,725 --> 00:53:14,364
你哪会认识他？你连我都不认识
{\fs14}How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.

566
00:53:14,485 --> 00:53:17,841
我在干嘛？简直浪费时间
{\fs14}I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time!

567
00:53:19,205 --> 00:53:21,400
我没法教他
{\fs14}I cannot teach him.

568
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:23,481
这孩子没耐心
{\fs14}The boy has no patience.

569
00:53:23,605 --> 00:53:25,755
他会学习忍耐
{\fs14}He will learn patience.

570
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:32,680
他心中充满怒气
{\fs14}Much anger in him...

571
00:53:32,805 --> 00:53:34,557
跟他父亲一样
{\fs14}like his father.

572
00:53:34,685 --> 00:53:38,234
我当时还不是一样？
{\fs14}Was I any different when you taught me?

573
00:53:39,565 --> 00:53:40,475
--
{\fs14}No.

574
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:44,477
- 他时候还没到   - 尤达！
{\fs14}- He is not ready. - Yoda.

575
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:49,237
我时候到了…
{\fs14}I am ready.

576
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:52,163
班，我可以当武士。班，你跟他说…
{\fs14}I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm-

577
00:53:52,285 --> 00:53:55,960
你时候到了？你知道什么？
{\fs14}Ready, are you? What know you ready?

578
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:59,873
我授徒已经八百年
{\fs14}For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

579
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:03,600
行不行，我自有定见
{\fs14}My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained.

580
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:09,114
武士要有绝对的决心
{\fs14}AJedi must have the deepest commitment...

581
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,997
最严肃的态度
{\fs14}the most serious mind.

582
00:54:12,925 --> 00:54:15,883
这个我观察很久了
{\fs14}This one a long time have I watched.

583
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:19,564
他一辈子都在
{\fs14}All his life has he looked away...

584
00:54:19,685 --> 00:54:22,597
往远处看
{\fs14}to the future, to the horizon.

585
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:26,115
就是不肯脚踏实地
{\fs14}Never his mind on where he was...

586
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:29,361
把眼前的事做好
{\fs14}what he was doing.

587
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:31,960
就爱冒险
{\fs14}Adventure.

588
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:34,843
找刺激
{\fs14}Excitement.

589
00:54:34,965 --> 00:54:37,115
武士不搞这些的
{\fs14}AJedi craves not these things.

590
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:39,763
你很卤莽
{\fs14}You are reckless.

591
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:42,718
我以前也是
{\fs14}So was I, if you remember.

592
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:44,801
他太老了
{\fs14}He is too old.

593
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:48,795
对，现在开始太晚了
{\fs14}Yes, too old to begin the training.

594
00:54:48,925 --> 00:54:50,756
但我学了好多
{\fs14}But I've learned so much.

595
00:54:58,285 --> 00:55:01,402
- 他能有始有终吗？   - 我不会让你失望
{\fs14}- Will he finish what he begins? - I won't fail you.

596
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:04,477
我不怕
{\fs14}I'm not afraid.

597
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,761
你会怕的
{\fs14}You will be.

598
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:13,841
你会怕的
{\fs14}You will be.

599
00:55:54,205 --> 00:55:57,561
- 请容我建议…   - 我不想听你建议
{\fs14}- Sir, if I may venture an opinion- - I'm not interested in your opinion.

600
00:55:57,685 --> 00:55:59,596
外头有东西
{\fs14}There's something out there.

601
00:55:59,725 --> 00:56:01,602
- 哪里？   - 在外面山洞里
{\fs14}- Where? - Outside in the cave.

602
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:04,678
那里，你听
{\fs14}There it is. Listen!

603
00:56:04,805 --> 00:56:06,602
- 我出去看看   - 你疯啦？
{\fs14}- I'm going out there. - Are you crazy?

604
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:09,159
这玩意儿刚修好，不能让人拆了
{\fs14}I just got this bucket together. I won't let it get torn apart.

605
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:11,321
那我跟你去
{\fs14}Then I'm going with you.

606
00:56:12,525 --> 00:56:15,483
我想我最好守着宇宙飞船
{\fs14}I think it might be better if I stay behind and guard the ship.

607
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:16,560
糟了…
{\fs14}Oh, no.

608
00:56:31,045 --> 00:56:33,001
这地面好奇怪
{\fs14}This ground sure feels strange.

609
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:36,521
好像不是岩石
{\fs14}It doesn't feel like rock.

610
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:43,313
湿气好重
{\fs14}There's an awful lot of moisture in here.

611
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:46,994
搞不清楚，总觉得不对劲
{\fs14}I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.

612
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:48,274
对
{\fs14}Yeah.

613
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:51,161
小心！
{\fs14}Watch out!

614
00:56:52,245 --> 00:56:54,600
没事，没事
{\fs14}It's all right. It's all right.

615
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:57,080
我就知道，太空蝙蝠
{\fs14}Yeah, that's what I thought- mynock.

616
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,197
阿秋，检查一下
{\fs14}Chewie, check the rest of the ship and make sure there are no more attached...

617
00:57:00,325 --> 00:57:02,122
别让它们咬电线
{\fs14}chewing on the power cables.

618
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:03,758
太空蝙蝠？
{\fs14}Mynocks?

619
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:06,001
进去，还有的话就赶走
{\fs14}Go inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.

620
00:57:14,805 --> 00:57:17,160
快走开！
{\fs14}Go away! Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

621
00:57:24,165 --> 00:57:25,917
等一下…
{\fs14}Wait a minute.

622
00:57:46,765 --> 00:57:50,041
- 阿秋，我们走！   - 帝国舰队还在外面，这样出去不好…
{\fs14}- Chewie, let's get out of here! - The Empire is still out there!

623
00:57:50,165 --> 00:57:52,121
没时间开会了
{\fs14}No time to discuss this in committee!

624
00:57:52,965 --> 00:57:54,921
我没说要开会！
{\fs14}I am not a committee!

625
00:58:00,165 --> 00:58:02,884
这里不能用光速
{\fs14}You can't make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field.

626
00:58:03,005 --> 00:58:05,360
坐下，甜心，要起飞了
{\fs14}Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off.

627
00:58:09,965 --> 00:58:11,239
- 看！   - 我看见了
{\fs14}- Look! - I see it.

628
00:58:11,365 --> 00:58:13,640
- 我们完了  - 山洞要垮了
{\fs14}- We're doomed! - The cave is collapsing.

629
00:58:13,765 --> 00:58:15,562
- 这不是山洞   - 什么？
{\fs14}- This is no cave. - What?

630
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:48,044
对，快跑
{\fs14}Yes, run.

631
00:58:48,165 --> 00:58:49,644
对
{\fs14}Yes.

632
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:52,962
武士的力量来自于原力
{\fs14}AJedi's strength flows from the Force.

633
00:58:53,085 --> 00:58:56,361
但要注意黑暗面的势力，愤怒、恐惧、侵略心
{\fs14}But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression-

634
00:58:56,485 --> 00:58:58,555
这就是原力的黑暗面
{\fs14}The dark side of the Force are they.

635
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:02,121
它在你战斗时，会很快到你心里
{\fs14}Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.

636
00:59:02,245 --> 00:59:04,361
一旦走入歧途
{\fs14}If once you start down the dark path...

637
00:59:04,485 --> 00:59:06,680
它就会主宰你的命运
{\fs14}forever will it dominate your destiny.

638
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:10,593
它会把你吞噬，就像欧比王的徒弟
{\fs14}Consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

639
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:12,477
黑武士
{\fs14}Vader.

640
00:59:12,605 --> 00:59:15,563
- 黑暗面比较强吗？  - 不…
{\fs14}- Is the dark side stronger? - No, no.

641
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:19,122
只是较快，较容易、诱惑力较大
{\fs14}Quicker, easier, more seductive.

642
00:59:19,965 --> 00:59:21,956
我如何分辨好坏？
{\fs14}How am I to know the good side from the bad?

643
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:24,235
你自然会知道
{\fs14}You will know...

644
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:26,515
你平静、沉寂的时候
{\fs14}when you are calm, at peace...

645
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:28,918
--
{\fs14}passive.

646
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:33,958
武士用原力来学习和防身
{\fs14}AJedi uses the Force for knowledge and defence...

647
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:35,837
而不是攻击
{\fs14}never for attack.

648
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:39,435
- 为什么不能…  - 不，别问
{\fs14}- But tell me why I can't- - No. There is no why.

649
00:59:39,565 --> 00:59:42,204
今天到此为止
{\fs14}Nothing more will I teach you today.

650
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:44,202
别再想这些问题
{\fs14}Clear your mind of questions.

651
01:00:06,365 --> 01:00:08,242
有点不对劲
{\fs14}There's something not right here.

652
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:13,318
好冷
{\fs14}I feel cold.

653
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:15,644
- 死亡   - 在那个地方…
{\fs14}- Death. - That place...

654
01:00:16,725 --> 01:00:20,081
原力的黑暗面很强
{\fs14}is strong with the dark side of the Force.

655
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:22,036
那是邪恶的境地
{\fs14}A domain of evil it is.

656
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:25,276
你得进去
{\fs14}In you must go.

657
01:00:26,445 --> 01:00:27,594
里头有什么？
{\fs14}What's in there?

658
01:00:30,245 --> 01:00:32,440
只有你所带去的
{\fs14}Only what you take with you.

659
01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:37,234
你的武器
{\fs14}Your weapons...

660
01:00:38,085 --> 01:00:39,484
你不用带着
{\fs14}you will not need them.

661
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,520
赏金猎人！谁需要这些人渣？
{\fs14}Bounty hunters. We don't need their scum.

662
01:03:15,645 --> 01:03:18,284
- 是的，长官   - 那些叛党跑不了
{\fs14}- Yes, sir. - Those rebels won't escape us.

663
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:26,916
“复仇者”号有重要讯息
{\fs14}Sir, we have a priority signal from the Stardestroyer Avenger.

664
01:03:27,045 --> 01:03:28,524
好
{\fs14}Right.

665
01:03:28,645 --> 01:03:34,197
找到千年鹰的有重赏
{\fs14}There will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.

666
01:03:34,325 --> 01:03:37,237
什么招式都可以用
{\fs14}You are free to use any methods necessary...

667
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:39,401
但我要活口
{\fs14}but I want them alive.

668
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:41,834
不要断手断脚
{\fs14}No disintegrations.

669
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:43,717
- 悉听尊便   - 维达勋爵
{\fs14}- As you wish. - Lord Vader.

670
01:03:45,925 --> 01:03:47,756
大人，有发现了
{\fs14}My lord, we have them.

671
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:55,003
终于脱离小行星群了
{\fs14}Thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.

672
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,513
我们快闪，准备光速飞行
{\fs14}Let's get out of here. Ready for light speed?

673
01:04:02,645 --> 01:04:04,761
一！二！
{\fs14}One, two...

674
01:04:04,885 --> 01:04:05,954
三！
{\fs14}three!

675
01:04:12,325 --> 01:04:14,475
怎么这样？
{\fs14}It's not fair.

676
01:04:16,005 --> 01:04:18,678
电路全都正常，这不能怪我！
{\fs14}Transfer circuits aren't working. It's not my fault.

677
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:21,603
- 不能用光速？   - 不是我的错
{\fs14}- No light speed? - It's not my fault.

678
01:04:26,205 --> 01:04:28,116
后面的主反射屏没了
{\fs14}Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield.

679
01:04:28,245 --> 01:04:30,395
舰尾再中弹，我们就完了
{\fs14}One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.

680
01:04:30,525 --> 01:04:32,163
掉头
{\fs14}Turn her around.

681
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,799
我说掉头！电力全转到前反射屏
{\fs14}Turn her around! I'm gonna put all power in the front shield.

682
01:04:34,925 --> 01:04:36,836
- 你要攻击他们？  - 正面攻击驱逐舰
{\fs14}- You're gonna attack? - The odds of surviving...

683
01:04:36,965 --> 01:04:38,796
还能全身而退的机率…
{\fs14}a direct assault on an imperial Stardestroyer-

684
01:04:38,925 --> 01:04:40,756
闭嘴！
{\fs14}Shut up!

685
01:04:47,005 --> 01:04:48,882
他们敢攻击我们！
{\fs14}They're moving to attack position.

686
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:52,040
立起反射屏
{\fs14}Shields up.

687
01:04:58,365 --> 01:05:00,833
追踪，他们可能掉头再来
{\fs14}Track them. They may come around for another pass.

688
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,240
倪舰长，侦测仪上看不到了
{\fs14}Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes.

689
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:06,835
不可能，它不可能有隐蔽装置
{\fs14}They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device.

690
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:10,640
- 但它失去了踪影  - 维达勋爵要知道情况
{\fs14}- There's no trace of them. - Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

691
01:05:13,525 --> 01:05:15,481
准备交通艇
{\fs14}Get a shuttle ready.

692
01:05:15,605 --> 01:05:19,359
我要负起丢人的责任，向大臣道歉
{\fs14}I shall assume full responsibility for losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

693
01:05:19,485 --> 01:05:22,443
- 你们继续扫描   - 是，倪舰长
{\fs14}- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. - Yes, Captain Needa.

694
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,115
用原力
{\fs14}Use the Force.

695
01:05:29,245 --> 01:05:30,200
对
{\fs14}Yes.

696
01:05:35,605 --> 01:05:37,277
移动石块
{\fs14}Now, the stone.

697
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:42,843
用感觉
{\fs14}Feel it.

698
01:05:54,085 --> 01:05:55,803
集中精神！
{\fs14}Concentrate!

699
01:06:09,885 --> 01:06:12,797
这下永远没救了
{\fs14}Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

700
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:14,563
你好肯定
{\fs14}So certain are you.

701
01:06:18,485 --> 01:06:21,557
你老是说没办法
{\fs14}Always with you it cannot be done.

702
01:06:22,765 --> 01:06:24,642
你不懂我的话吗？
{\fs14}Hear you nothing that I say?

703
01:06:24,765 --> 01:06:26,756
师父，石头是一回事
{\fs14}Master, moving stones around is one thing.

704
01:06:26,885 --> 01:06:28,637
这可完全不同
{\fs14}This is totally different.

705
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:30,915
没什么不同
{\fs14}No. No different.

706
01:06:31,045 --> 01:06:33,036
只是你觉得不同
{\fs14}Only different in your mind.

707
01:06:33,165 --> 01:06:36,237
你要忘掉以前所学
{\fs14}You must unlearn what you have learned.

708
01:06:37,565 --> 01:06:40,523
- 好吧，我试试看   - 不对，不要“试”
{\fs14}- All right. I'll give it a try. - Try not.

709
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:42,718
要“做”
{\fs14}Do...

710
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:44,358
否则就别做
{\fs14}or do not.

711
01:06:44,485 --> 01:06:46,077
没什么试不试的
{\fs14}There is no try.

712
01:07:32,725 --> 01:07:35,523
没办法，太大了
{\fs14}I can't. It's too big.

713
01:07:35,645 --> 01:07:37,601
大小不是问题
{\fs14}Size matters not.

714
01:07:37,725 --> 01:07:40,603
你看我，你看我不起眼，对不对？
{\fs14}Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?

715
01:07:43,245 --> 01:07:45,998
这样你就错了
{\fs14}And well you should not...

716
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:48,639
我有原力来帮助我
{\fs14}for my ally is the Force.

717
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:51,040
它是莫大的助力
{\fs14}And a powerful ally it is.

718
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:54,360
生命创造了原力
{\fs14}Life creates it...

719
01:07:54,485 --> 01:07:56,441
让它壮大
{\fs14}makes it grow.

720
01:07:57,285 --> 01:07:59,958
它的能量围绕着我们
{\fs14}Its energy surrounds us...

721
01:08:00,965 --> 01:08:02,683
维系着我们
{\fs14}and binds us.

722
01:08:02,805 --> 01:08:05,877
我们是聪明的生物，不是粗糙的东西
{\fs14}Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.

723
01:08:06,925 --> 01:08:10,042
你要感觉周围的原力
{\fs14}You must feel the Force around you.

724
01:08:10,885 --> 01:08:13,353
这里，在你我之间
{\fs14}Here, between you, me...

725
01:08:14,205 --> 01:08:16,355
那棵树，石头
{\fs14}the tree, the rock-

726
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:18,476
无所不在
{\fs14}everywhere.

727
01:08:18,605 --> 01:08:19,958
对
{\fs14}Yes...

728
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:23,714
甚至在土地和宇宙飞船之间
{\fs14}even between the land and the ship.

729
01:08:28,445 --> 01:08:30,595
这是强人所难
{\fs14}You want the impossible.

730
01:10:13,725 --> 01:10:15,681
我…我不敢相信
{\fs14}I don't believe it.

731
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:20,165
所以你会失败
{\fs14}That is why you fail.

732
01:10:38,645 --> 01:10:41,762
我接受你的道歉，倪舰长
{\fs14}Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

733
01:10:49,925 --> 01:10:52,837
大臣，我们搜遍了，毫无发现
{\fs14}Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan and found nothing.

734
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:54,842
他们若用光速
{\fs14}If the Millennium Falcon went into light speed...

735
01:10:54,965 --> 01:10:56,796
早已跑远了
{\fs14}it'll be on the other side of the galaxy now.

736
01:10:56,925 --> 01:10:58,677
通报各指挥部
{\fs14}Alert all commands.

737
01:10:58,805 --> 01:11:02,878
注意他们可能的航向
{\fs14}Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory.

738
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:06,236
- 是，他们跑不了   - 别再让我失望
{\fs14}- Yes, my lord. We'll find them. - Don't fail me again...

739
01:11:07,165 --> 01:11:09,076
将军
{\fs14}Admiral.

740
01:11:11,165 --> 01:11:14,316
通报各指挥部，快部署
{\fs14}Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.

741
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:31,762
苏洛舰长，这回太夸张了
{\fs14}Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.

742
01:11:31,885 --> 01:11:34,843
我就不闭嘴，秋巴卡。怎么就没人听我的？
{\fs14}I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

743
01:11:34,965 --> 01:11:36,921
舰队要散开了
{\fs14}The fleet's beginning to break up.

744
01:11:37,045 --> 01:11:39,798
到后头准备脱离
{\fs14}Go stand by the manual release for the landing claw.

745
01:11:42,045 --> 01:11:43,956
这样有什么用呢？
{\fs14}I really don't see how that's going to help.

746
01:11:44,085 --> 01:11:47,395
在特别情况下，投降是很正常的事
{\fs14}Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances.

747
01:11:47,525 --> 01:11:49,516
他们可能会…
{\fs14}The Empire may be gracious enough-

748
01:11:49,645 --> 01:11:51,954
- 谢了   - 下一步怎么办？
{\fs14}- Thank you. - What did you have in mind next?

749
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:53,916
若按照正常程序，他们会先丢垃圾
{\fs14}If they follow standard imperial procedure...

750
01:11:54,045 --> 01:11:56,195
才开始光速飞行
{\fs14}they'll dump their garbage before they go to light speed.

751
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:59,203
- 我们就可以飘开   - 跟垃圾一起
{\fs14}- Then we just float away. - With the rest of the garbage.

752
01:11:59,325 --> 01:12:00,678
然后呢？
{\fs14}Then what?

753
01:12:00,805 --> 01:12:03,922
在附近找个落脚地
{\fs14}Then we gotta find a safe port somewhere around here.

754
01:12:04,045 --> 01:12:05,364
有哪里可去？
{\fs14}Any ideas?

755
01:12:05,485 --> 01:12:07,760
- 这是哪里？   - 安诺亚星系
{\fs14}- Where are we? - The Anoat system.

756
01:12:07,885 --> 01:12:10,353
安诺亚没地方可去
{\fs14}The Anoat system. There's not much there.

757
01:12:10,485 --> 01:12:13,204
对，等一下…有意思
{\fs14}Oh, wait. This is interesting.

758
01:12:13,325 --> 01:12:16,078
- 蓝多！   - 蓝多星系？
{\fs14}- Lando. - Lando system?

759
01:12:16,205 --> 01:12:19,641
不，蓝多是个人，蓝多卡瑞辛
{\fs14}Lando's not a system. He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

760
01:12:19,765 --> 01:12:21,915
他爱打牌、赌博
{\fs14}Card player, gambler.

761
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:24,513
- 十足无赖，正对你味口   - 谢了
{\fs14}- A scoundrel. You'd like him. - Thanks.

762
01:12:24,645 --> 01:12:27,205
在贝斯平，满远的，但我们到得了
{\fs14}Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.

763
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:31,557
- 采矿区？   - 对，提班纳瓦斯
{\fs14}- A mining colony? - Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

764
01:12:32,405 --> 01:12:34,441
蓝多跟人家骗来的
{\fs14}Lando conned somebody out of it.

765
01:12:34,565 --> 01:12:37,159
他跟我是老交情
{\fs14}We go back a long way, Lando and me.

766
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:41,085
- 能信任他吗？   - 不
{\fs14}- Can you trust him? - No.

767
01:12:41,205 --> 01:12:43,958
但是他痛恨帝国
{\fs14}But he's got no love for the Empire. I can tell you that.

768
01:12:45,005 --> 01:12:47,519
阿秋，准备，脱离
{\fs14}Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach.

769
01:12:54,445 --> 01:12:55,924
你有时很英明
{\fs14}You do have your moments.

770
01:12:56,765 --> 01:12:59,484
难得一次，但还算不错
{\fs14}Not many of them, but you do have them.

771
01:13:32,845 --> 01:13:34,676
集中精神
{\fs14}Concentrate.

772
01:13:34,805 --> 01:13:37,877
感觉原力的流动
{\fs14}Feel the Force flow.

773
01:13:38,005 --> 01:13:39,563
对了
{\fs14}Yes.

774
01:13:46,925 --> 01:13:48,517
好
{\fs14}Good.

775
01:13:48,645 --> 01:13:49,964
冷静
{\fs14}Calm.

776
01:13:50,085 --> 01:13:51,359
对
{\fs14}Yes.

777
01:13:52,285 --> 01:13:54,719
透过原力，会看见一些东西
{\fs14}Through the Force, things you will see.

778
01:13:54,845 --> 01:13:58,155
别的地方，未来、过去
{\fs14}Other places. The future. The past.

779
01:13:58,285 --> 01:14:00,594
早已不在的朋友
{\fs14}Old friends long gone.

780
01:14:10,685 --> 01:14:12,084
要控制
{\fs14}Control, control.

781
01:14:12,205 --> 01:14:14,321
你要学着控制
{\fs14}You must learn control.

782
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:20,043
我看见…一座城市在云间
{\fs14}I saw a city in the clouds.

783
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:24,115
你在那里有朋友
{\fs14}Friends you have there.

784
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:28,635
- 他们在受苦   - 你看到的是未来
{\fs14}- They were in pain. - It is the future you see.

785
01:14:29,805 --> 01:14:30,760
未来？
{\fs14}Future?

786
01:14:39,405 --> 01:14:40,758
他们会不会死？
{\fs14}Will they die?

787
01:14:43,885 --> 01:14:45,876
很难说
{\fs14}Difficult to see.

788
01:14:46,005 --> 01:14:48,360
未来总是在变
{\fs14}Always in motion is the future.

789
01:14:50,765 --> 01:14:52,118
我要去找他们
{\fs14}I've gotta go to them.

790
01:14:54,045 --> 01:14:56,957
你要想出最好的方法
{\fs14}Decide you must how to serve them best.

791
01:14:57,085 --> 01:14:59,838
你现在离开，可以帮助他们
{\fs14}If you leave now, help them you could...

792
01:15:00,885 --> 01:15:04,275
但会破坏他们努力的目标
{\fs14}but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.

793
01:15:17,765 --> 01:15:20,438
我没有降落许可
{\fs14}No, I don't have a landing permit.

794
01:15:20,565 --> 01:15:24,035
我找蓝多卡瑞辛
{\fs14}I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

795
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:26,201
等一下，让我解释
{\fs14}Wait a minute! Let me explain!

796
01:15:26,325 --> 01:15:28,202
不许偏离目前航道
{\fs14}You will not deviate from your present course.

797
01:15:28,325 --> 01:15:30,919
- 脾气可真暴躁   - 你不是认识他吗？
{\fs14}- Rather touchy, aren't they? - I thought you knew this person.

798
01:15:33,725 --> 01:15:36,398
隔太久了
{\fs14}That was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

799
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:48,115
准许降落327平台
{\fs14}Permission granted to land on Platform 327.

800
01:15:48,245 --> 01:15:49,564
谢谢
{\fs14}Thank you.

801
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:53,198
不用担心，我跟他是老交情
{\fs14}Nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.

802
01:15:53,325 --> 01:15:54,917
谁担心啦？
{\fs14}Who's worried?

803
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,118
没半个人
{\fs14}No one to meet us.

804
01:16:44,485 --> 01:16:46,715
不太对劲
{\fs14}I don't like this.

805
01:16:46,845 --> 01:16:49,564
- 怎样才对劲？   - 降落倒是没问题
{\fs14}- What would you like? - They did let us land.

806
01:16:49,685 --> 01:16:52,279
别担心，没问题的
{\fs14}Look, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.

807
01:16:52,405 --> 01:16:53,963
相信我
{\fs14}Trust me.

808
01:16:58,525 --> 01:17:00,481
看吧？ 我朋友来了
{\fs14}See? My friend.

809
01:17:04,725 --> 01:17:06,681
眼睛睁亮点
{\fs14}Keep your eyes open.

810
01:17:09,285 --> 01:17:10,843
嘿
{\fs14}Hey.

811
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:14,878
你这个龌龊，吃里扒外的下三滥
{\fs14}Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler.

812
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:19,044
你还有胆回来见我？
{\fs14}You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.

813
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:32,435
怎么样，老海盗？真高兴见到你
{\fs14}How you doin', you old pirate? So good to see you!

814
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:35,477
- 没想到有这么一天   - 好像很友善
{\fs14}- I never thought I'd see you again. - Well, he seems very friendly.

815
01:17:35,605 --> 01:17:38,563
对，非常友善
{\fs14}Yes. Very friendly.

816
01:17:38,685 --> 01:17:40,243
你来干嘛？
{\fs14}What are you doing here?

817
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,276
修船，我想请你帮忙
{\fs14}Repairs. I thought you could help me out.

818
01:17:42,405 --> 01:17:44,919
- 我的船怎么啦？   - 你的船？
{\fs14}- What have you done to my ship? - Your ship?

819
01:17:45,045 --> 01:17:48,435
你把它输给我了
{\fs14}Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.

820
01:17:49,285 --> 01:17:50,604
你好吗，秋巴卡？
{\fs14}How you doin', Chewbacca?

821
01:17:51,525 --> 01:17:54,085
还在跟这家伙混？
{\fs14}Still hanging around with this loser?

822
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,235
哈，这位是谁？
{\fs14}Hello. What have we here?

823
01:17:59,685 --> 01:18:03,075
欢迎，我是蓝多卡瑞辛，这里由我当家
{\fs14}Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility.

824
01:18:03,205 --> 01:18:06,003
- 是…？   - 莉亚
{\fs14}- And who might you be? - Leia.

825
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,683
欢迎，莉亚
{\fs14}Welcome, Leia.

826
01:18:10,405 --> 01:18:13,124
够了…老滑头
{\fs14}All right, all right. You old smoothie.

827
01:18:13,245 --> 01:18:16,715
我是C3PO，专长人类与机器人沟通…
{\fs14}Hello, sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

828
01:18:16,845 --> 01:18:19,518
真是的！
{\fs14}My facilities are at your- Well, really!

829
01:18:19,645 --> 01:18:21,920
- 千年鹰哪里有问题？   - 加速器
{\fs14}- What's wrong with the Falcon? - Hyperdrive.

830
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:24,001
- 我叫人检修    - 好
{\fs14}- I'll get my people to work on her. - Good.

831
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,081
这艘船救了我几次
{\fs14}That ship saved my life quite a few times.

832
01:18:26,205 --> 01:18:28,639
银河里没人比它快
{\fs14}She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

833
01:18:29,925 --> 01:18:32,280
矿场怎么样？有赚头吗？
{\fs14}How's the gas mine? Still paying off for you?

834
01:18:32,405 --> 01:18:36,080
没那么好赚，这里规模小，没法自给自足
{\fs14}Not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient.

835
01:18:36,205 --> 01:18:39,163
补给问题很严重
{\fs14}I've had supply problems of every kind.

836
01:18:39,285 --> 01:18:41,355
人手也缺…
{\fs14}I've had labour difficulties.

837
01:18:41,485 --> 01:18:44,602
- 什么好笑的？   - 你啊
{\fs14}- What's so funny? - You. Listen to you.

838
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:47,398
口气像生意人，负责任的人
{\fs14}You sound like a businessman, a responsible leader.

839
01:18:47,525 --> 01:18:49,322
当初谁能想到？
{\fs14}Who'd have thought that, huh?

840
01:18:49,445 --> 01:18:52,243
你真是让我想起从前
{\fs14}Seeing you sure brings back a few things.

841
01:18:52,365 --> 01:18:53,514
--
{\fs14}Yeah.

842
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,681
对，我现在有责任
{\fs14}Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

843
01:18:56,525 --> 01:18:59,085
这是成功的代价
{\fs14}It's the price you pay for being successful.

844
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:04,161
有个熟面孔真好
{\fs14}Nice to see a familiar face.

845
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:05,843
真没礼貌！
{\fs14}How rude!

846
01:19:07,365 --> 01:19:09,321
好像有个R2，不知道…
{\fs14}That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

847
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:10,958
哈？
{\fs14}I wonder if- Hello?

848
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:14,604
真有意思
{\fs14}How interesting.

849
01:19:14,725 --> 01:19:17,683
- 你是谁？   - 哦，真是对不起
{\fs14}- Who are you? - Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

850
01:19:17,805 --> 01:19:19,761
不是故意打扰，不，别起来…
{\fs14}I didn't mean to intrude. Please don't get up.

851
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:39,953
卢克，你还没出师
{\fs14}Luke, you must complete the training.

852
01:19:41,005 --> 01:19:43,678
没办法，我要去救我朋友
{\fs14}I can't keep the vision out of my head. I've gotta help them.

853
01:19:43,805 --> 01:19:45,841
你不能去
{\fs14}You must not go.

854
01:19:45,965 --> 01:19:48,923
- 老韩跟莉亚会死掉   - 不能如此肯定
{\fs14}- But Han and Leia will die if I don't. - You don't know that.

855
01:19:51,805 --> 01:19:54,365
连尤达都看不准
{\fs14}Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

856
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:57,124
但我能救他们，我能感觉到原力
{\fs14}But I can help them. I feel the Force.

857
01:19:57,245 --> 01:19:59,315
但你无法控制它
{\fs14}But you cannot control it.

858
01:19:59,525 --> 01:20:01,755
这是个危险的时刻
{\fs14}This is a dangerous time for you...

859
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:04,763
你容易被黑暗面诱惑
{\fs14}when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.

860
01:20:04,885 --> 01:20:07,957
对，要听他的话
{\fs14}Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen.

861
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,158
想想那个洞
{\fs14}The cave.

862
01:20:10,285 --> 01:20:12,276
记得在洞里的事
{\fs14}Remember your failure at the cave.

863
01:20:12,405 --> 01:20:14,236
但我后来有进步
{\fs14}But I've learned so much since then.

864
01:20:14,365 --> 01:20:16,925
我保证会回来，把该学的学完
{\fs14}Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun.

865
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:18,922
我向你保证
{\fs14}You have my word.

866
01:20:19,045 --> 01:20:21,718
皇帝要的是你
{\fs14}It is you and your abilities the emperor wants.

867
01:20:21,845 --> 01:20:24,439
因此才折磨你的朋友
{\fs14}That is why your friends are made to suffer.

868
01:20:25,845 --> 01:20:28,405
所以我得赶去
{\fs14}That's why I have to go.

869
01:20:28,525 --> 01:20:32,677
我不要你跟黑武士一样，成了皇帝的手下
{\fs14}Luke, I don't want to lose you to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

870
01:20:32,805 --> 01:20:34,238
不会的
{\fs14}You won't.

871
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:38,521
要阻止他们，一切就靠这个
{\fs14}Stopped they must be. On this all depends.

872
01:20:39,365 --> 01:20:42,675
唯有学成的绝地武士，有原力的辅助
{\fs14}Only a fully trained Jedi knight, with the Force as his ally...

873
01:20:42,805 --> 01:20:45,273
才能打败黑武士和皇帝
{\fs14}will conquer Vader and his emperor.

874
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:47,396
你此时离开
{\fs14}If you end your training now...

875
01:20:47,525 --> 01:20:51,643
你若选择走快捷方式，跟黑武士一样
{\fs14}if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did...

876
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:54,279
就会变成他们的爪牙
{\fs14}you will become an agent of evil.

877
01:20:54,405 --> 01:20:55,315
要有耐心
{\fs14}Patience.

878
01:20:56,245 --> 01:21:00,443
- 把老韩跟莉亚牺牲掉？   - 你尊重他们的目标，就得如此
{\fs14}- And sacrifice Han and Leia? - If you honour what they fight for...

879
01:21:00,565 --> 01:21:01,520
是的
{\fs14}yes.

880
01:21:01,645 --> 01:21:04,603
你若跟黑武士挑战，要独力战斗
{\fs14}If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone.

881
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:06,636
我不能介入
{\fs14}I cannot interfere.

882
01:21:08,645 --> 01:21:09,794
我了解
{\fs14}I understand.

883
01:21:15,085 --> 01:21:17,758
R2，发动机器
{\fs14}R2, fire up the converters.

884
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:24,802
别沉溺于仇恨
{\fs14}Don't give in to hate.

885
01:21:24,925 --> 01:21:27,564
否则会走向黑暗面
{\fs14}That leads to the dark side.

886
01:21:27,685 --> 01:21:29,323
黑武士很厉害
{\fs14}Strong is Vader.

887
01:21:29,445 --> 01:21:31,834
牢记已经学会的，它能保你的命
{\fs14}Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.

888
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:34,198
我会的
{\fs14}I will.

889
01:21:34,325 --> 01:21:36,680
而且我会回来，我保证
{\fs14}And I'll return. I promise.

890
01:21:43,485 --> 01:21:46,397
我早就说了，他很卤莽
{\fs14}Told you, I did. Reckless is he.

891
01:21:46,525 --> 01:21:48,038
现在
{\fs14}Now...

892
01:21:48,165 --> 01:21:49,837
更糟糕了
{\fs14}matters are worse.

893
01:21:49,965 --> 01:21:51,921
他是唯一的指望
{\fs14}That boy is our last hope.

894
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:54,843
不，还有一个
{\fs14}No, there is another.

895
01:22:25,685 --> 01:22:28,836
船快修好了，只差两三样东西
{\fs14}The ship's almost finished. Two or three more things and we're in great shape.

896
01:22:28,965 --> 01:22:30,921
越快越好，有点不对劲
{\fs14}The sooner the better. Something's wrong here.

897
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:33,001
没人知道3PO下落
{\fs14}No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.

898
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,241
它不可能只是迷路
{\fs14}He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.

899
01:22:35,365 --> 01:22:37,003
放心
{\fs14}Relax.

900
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,878
我去跟蓝多打听
{\fs14}I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.

901
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:42,360
我不信任他
{\fs14}I don't trust Lando.

902
01:22:42,485 --> 01:22:45,682
我也不信任他，但他是我朋友
{\fs14}Well, I don't trust him either, but he is my friend.

903
01:22:45,805 --> 01:22:48,365
何况，我们就要走了
{\fs14}Besides, we'll soon be gone.

904
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:51,721
那表示你也要走了
{\fs14}Then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

905
01:23:25,325 --> 01:23:26,758
怎么啦？
{\fs14}What happened?

906
01:23:27,805 --> 01:23:28,442
哪里？
{\fs14}Where?

907
01:23:30,525 --> 01:23:32,436
废料堆找到的？
{\fs14}Found him in a junk pile?

908
01:23:32,565 --> 01:23:34,999
怎么会这样？阿秋，你会不会修？
{\fs14}What a mess. Chewie, you think you can repair him?

909
01:23:37,085 --> 01:23:40,441
- 蓝多的手下会修   - 不要
{\fs14}- Lando's got people that can fix him. - No, thanks.

910
01:23:41,965 --> 01:23:43,717
抱歉，是不是打扰了？
{\fs14}I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?

911
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:45,714
不会
{\fs14}Not really.

912
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:51,036
简直美极了
{\fs14}You look absolutely beautiful.

913
01:23:51,165 --> 01:23:54,316
你属于这个云间城市
{\fs14}You truly belong here with us among the clouds.

914
01:23:54,445 --> 01:23:55,844
谢谢
{\fs14}Thank you.

915
01:23:55,965 --> 01:23:58,763
来吃点点心好吗？
{\fs14}Would you join me for a little refreshment?

916
01:23:58,885 --> 01:24:01,558
大家一起来
{\fs14}Everyone's invited, of course.

917
01:24:01,685 --> 01:24:03,676
机器人出了问题？
{\fs14}Having trouble with your droid?

918
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:06,319
没问题，为什么问呢？
{\fs14}No. No problem. Why?

919
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:17,194
我们规模很小
{\fs14}You see, since we're a small operation...

920
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:20,442
不受帝国的约束
{\fs14}we don't fall into the jurisdiction of the Empire.

921
01:24:20,565 --> 01:24:22,999
- 你是公会成员？   - 也不是
{\fs14}- So you're part of the Mining Guild? - No, not actually.

922
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:25,195
没人注意我们
{\fs14}Our operation is small enough not to be noticed.

923
01:24:25,325 --> 01:24:27,281
这样最好
{\fs14}Which is advantageous for everybody...

924
01:24:27,405 --> 01:24:31,637
因为顾客也不想引人注意
{\fs14}since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.

925
01:24:31,765 --> 01:24:35,474
你不怕帝国发现，把你们关了？
{\fs14}Aren't you afraid the Empire's gonna find out, shut you down?

926
01:24:35,605 --> 01:24:38,756
有这个危险，就像一朵云悬在天上
{\fs14}It's been a danger that looms like a shadow over everything we've built.

927
01:24:38,885 --> 01:24:41,479
但现在我不怕了
{\fs14}But things have developed that'll ensure security.

928
01:24:41,605 --> 01:24:44,756
我跟帝国谈妥了
{\fs14}I've just made a deal that'll keep the Empire out of here forever.

929
01:24:54,085 --> 01:24:56,758
他们不会再烦我，请跟我们一起享用
{\fs14}We would be honoured if you would join us.

930
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:05,640
我是逼不得已，他们早一步到
{\fs14}I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.

931
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:08,157
抱歉
{\fs14}I'm sorry.

932
01:25:11,525 --> 01:25:12,799
我也很遗憾
{\fs14}I'm sorry too.

933
01:25:27,045 --> 01:25:28,364
不，3PO跟他们一起
{\fs14}No, 3PO's with them.

934
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:31,716
等一下，马上就到了
{\fs14}Just hang on. We're almost there.

935
01:26:28,845 --> 01:26:31,200
我不是故意打扰
{\fs14}I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.

936
01:26:31,325 --> 01:26:33,202
不…别起来
{\fs14}No, please don't get up.

937
01:26:38,805 --> 01:26:42,036
突击队？ 在这里？我们有危险了
{\fs14}Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger.

938
01:26:42,165 --> 01:26:44,633
快告诉其它人，糟糕！中弹了！
{\fs14}I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

939
01:27:11,325 --> 01:27:12,883
维达勋爵
{\fs14}Lord Vader.

940
01:27:13,005 --> 01:27:15,280
等我抓到天行者
{\fs14}You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt...

941
01:27:15,405 --> 01:27:17,316
韩苏洛就是你的人
{\fs14}after I have Skywalker.

942
01:27:17,445 --> 01:27:19,242
他死掉就没用处了
{\fs14}He's no good to me dead.

943
01:27:19,365 --> 01:27:22,516
他不会有大碍
{\fs14}He will not be permanently damaged.

944
01:27:24,845 --> 01:27:27,279
维达勋爵，莉亚跟武技兽呢？
{\fs14}Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?

945
01:27:27,405 --> 01:27:29,999
别让他们离开这里
{\fs14}They must never again leave this city.

946
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:33,197
我们没说好，也没说把老韩交给他
{\fs14}That wasn't part of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

947
01:27:33,325 --> 01:27:37,079
你说我亏待你？
{\fs14}Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly?

948
01:27:39,725 --> 01:27:40,680
没有
{\fs14}No.

949
01:27:40,805 --> 01:27:44,195
那就好，不然我就派兵驻扎此地
{\fs14}Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.

950
01:27:46,525 --> 01:27:48,800
这买卖越来越不利
{\fs14}This deal is getting worse all the time.

951
01:27:49,965 --> 01:27:52,240
这样很好，我很喜欢
{\fs14}Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that.

952
01:27:53,805 --> 01:27:56,239
不对，我看不见
{\fs14}Something's not right because now I can't see.

953
01:27:58,685 --> 01:28:00,801
这样好多了
{\fs14}That's much better.

954
01:28:00,925 --> 01:28:02,483
等一下…
{\fs14}Wait. Wait.

955
01:28:02,605 --> 01:28:04,561
我的天！你怎么弄的？
{\fs14}Oh, my! What have you done?

956
01:28:04,685 --> 01:28:06,164
怎么装反了？
{\fs14}I'm backwards!

957
01:28:06,285 --> 01:28:08,082
真是个笨毛球
{\fs14}You flea-bitten furball!

958
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:10,765
拖把都比你聪明…
{\fs14}Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough-

959
01:28:24,765 --> 01:28:26,642
我好难过
{\fs14}I feel terrible.

960
01:28:41,285 --> 01:28:43,241
他们这是为什么？
{\fs14}Why are they doing this?

961
01:28:45,645 --> 01:28:48,205
连问都没问一句
{\fs14}They never even asked me any questions.

962
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,235
- 蓝多，滚出去！   - 住嘴，听我说
{\fs14}- Get out of here, Lando. - Shut up and listen.

963
01:28:59,365 --> 01:29:02,323
维达把莉亚跟阿秋交给我
{\fs14}Vader's agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

964
01:29:02,445 --> 01:29:04,242
他们至少很安全
{\fs14}They'll have to stay here, but they'll be safe.

965
01:29:04,365 --> 01:29:06,401
- 老韩呢？   - 交给那个赏金猎人
{\fs14}- And Han? - Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

966
01:29:06,525 --> 01:29:08,834
- 维达要我们死   - 他不要你们
{\fs14}- Vader wants us all dead. - He doesn't want you at all.

967
01:29:08,965 --> 01:29:12,196
他要的人叫…天行者
{\fs14}He's after somebody called Skywalker.

968
01:29:12,325 --> 01:29:14,759
- 维达设了陷阱   - 我们成了钓饵
{\fs14}- Lord Vader set a trap for him. - And we're the bait.

969
01:29:14,885 --> 01:29:16,637
- 对，他已在路上   - 太好了
{\fs14}- He's on his way. - Perfect.

970
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:19,681
这下被你整惨了
{\fs14}You fixed us all real good, didn't you?

971
01:29:19,805 --> 01:29:20,920
老友
{\fs14}My friend.

972
01:29:23,805 --> 01:29:24,954
够了！
{\fs14}Stop!

973
01:29:26,205 --> 01:29:28,275
我已经尽了力
{\fs14}I've done all I can.

974
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:30,714
很抱歉只能做到这样
{\fs14}Sorry I couldn't do better, but I got my own problems.

975
01:29:30,845 --> 01:29:32,073
对
{\fs14}Yeah.

976
01:29:32,205 --> 01:29:33,957
你是个大英雄
{\fs14}You're a real hero.

977
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:46,680
你待人接物有一套
{\fs14}You certainly have a way with people.

978
01:30:00,485 --> 01:30:02,237
这设备很简陋
{\fs14}This facility is crude...

979
01:30:02,365 --> 01:30:05,323
但应可将他
{\fs14}but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker...

980
01:30:05,445 --> 01:30:07,595
送到皇上面前
{\fs14}for his journey to the emperor.

981
01:30:07,725 --> 01:30:10,603
维达勋爵，舰艇接近，X翼级舰
{\fs14}Lord Vader, ship approaching, X-wing class.

982
01:30:10,725 --> 01:30:13,956
好，开始监视，让他降落
{\fs14}Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.

983
01:30:15,445 --> 01:30:19,961
这是冻碳设备，不能用在人身上
{\fs14}Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

984
01:30:20,085 --> 01:30:22,838
我不能让他出差错
{\fs14}I do not want the emperor's prize damaged.

985
01:30:22,965 --> 01:30:25,923
先拿韩苏洛试试
{\fs14}We will test it on Captain Solo.

986
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:52,764
把我的腿接上，就不会这么糗了
{\fs14}If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position.

987
01:30:52,885 --> 01:30:55,445
记住，秋巴卡，你要负责把我修好
{\fs14}Now remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility for me...

988
01:30:55,565 --> 01:30:57,203
你可别做傻事
{\fs14}so don't do anything foolish.

989
01:31:10,725 --> 01:31:12,681
怎么啦？
{\fs14}What's going on, buddy?

990
01:31:13,605 --> 01:31:15,596
你要被抓去冻结
{\fs14}You're being put into carbon freeze.

991
01:31:15,725 --> 01:31:19,081
他死了怎么办？ 他可值钱得很
{\fs14}What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.

992
01:31:19,205 --> 01:31:22,436
要是死了，帝国赔你。放进去
{\fs14}The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in.

993
01:31:26,245 --> 01:31:27,360
不要！不要！住手
{\fs14}Chewbacca, stop!

994
01:31:27,485 --> 01:31:29,396
不要，阿秋！住手！听到没？
{\fs14}No, Chewie, stop!

995
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:32,403
住手！拜托你，不要！我还不想死
{\fs14}You're going to get us all killed! Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

996
01:31:32,525 --> 01:31:34,402
喂，听我说
{\fs14}Hey! Hey! Listen to me.

997
01:31:34,525 --> 01:31:36,914
阿秋，这样帮不了我
{\fs14}Chewie, this won't help me.

998
01:31:37,045 --> 01:31:39,513
省点力气，以后还会碰头
{\fs14}Hey, save your strength. There'll be another time.

999
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:42,883
公主…
{\fs14}The princess.

1000
01:31:43,005 --> 01:31:44,677
就托你照顾了
{\fs14}You have to take care of her.

1001
01:31:46,845 --> 01:31:48,756
听到没有？
{\fs14}Do you hear me?

1002
01:32:02,085 --> 01:32:04,918
- 我爱你   - 我知道
{\fs14}- I love you. - I know.

1003
01:32:32,925 --> 01:32:36,361
怎么回事？ 转个身秋巴卡，我看不见
{\fs14}What's going on? Turn round. I can't see.

1004
01:33:32,845 --> 01:33:34,801
他被碳包住了
{\fs14}They've encased him in carbonite.

1005
01:33:34,925 --> 01:33:36,722
保护满周密的
{\fs14}He should be quite well-protected...

1006
01:33:36,845 --> 01:33:38,676
如果没被冻死的话
{\fs14}if he survived the freezing process, that is.

1007
01:33:38,805 --> 01:33:41,194
卡瑞辛，他是不是活着？
{\fs14}Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

1008
01:33:41,325 --> 01:33:42,883
还活着
{\fs14}Yes, he's alive.

1009
01:33:43,725 --> 01:33:45,522
在蛰伏状态
{\fs14}And in perfect hibernation.

1010
01:33:46,445 --> 01:33:48,481
就交给你了，赏金猎人
{\fs14}He's all yours, bounty hunter.

1011
01:33:49,325 --> 01:33:50,963
准备让天行者进去
{\fs14}Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

1012
01:33:53,285 --> 01:33:55,037
他刚降落，大臣
{\fs14}Skywalker has just landed, lord.

1013
01:33:55,165 --> 01:33:58,874
好，让他往这里走
{\fs14}Good. See to it that he finds his way in here.

1014
01:34:02,965 --> 01:34:04,762
卡瑞辛
{\fs14}Calrissian...

1015
01:34:04,885 --> 01:34:07,194
把公主押到我的舰上
{\fs14}take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.

1016
01:34:07,325 --> 01:34:09,361
你叫他们留在这里
{\fs14}You said they'd be left under my supervision.

1017
01:34:09,485 --> 01:34:11,441
我要改变条件
{\fs14}I am altering the deal.

1018
01:34:11,565 --> 01:34:14,159
你可以祈祷不会再改变
{\fs14}Pray I don't alter it any further.

1019
01:35:47,445 --> 01:35:49,879
卢克！别进来！是个陷阱！
{\fs14}Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1020
01:35:51,325 --> 01:35:52,360
有陷阱！
{\fs14}It's a trap!

1021
01:36:36,885 --> 01:36:39,160
你有原力的辅助，天行者
{\fs14}The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

1022
01:36:41,485 --> 01:36:43,441
但你还称不上武士
{\fs14}But you are not a Jedi yet.

1023
01:37:42,925 --> 01:37:44,483
漂亮！
{\fs14}Well done.

1024
01:37:46,205 --> 01:37:48,878
把他们关在塔里，小声一点
{\fs14}Hold them in the security tower. And keep it quiet.

1025
01:37:49,005 --> 01:37:50,597
快
{\fs14}Move.

1026
01:37:54,885 --> 01:37:58,036
- 你要干嘛？   - 我们要走了
{\fs14}- What do you think you're doing? - We're getting out of here.

1027
01:37:58,165 --> 01:37:59,837
我早知道，一定是弄错了
{\fs14}I knew all along. It had to be a mistake.

1028
01:37:59,965 --> 01:38:02,684
你这样对老韩，我们还会信任你？
{\fs14}Do you think that after what you did to Han-

1029
01:38:03,645 --> 01:38:06,796
- 我是不得已   - 你干嘛？信任他！
{\fs14}- I had no choice. - What are you doing? Trust him!

1030
01:38:06,925 --> 01:38:09,803
我们了解，对不对？他是不得已
{\fs14}We understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.

1031
01:38:09,925 --> 01:38:11,404
我只是想帮忙
{\fs14}I'm just trying to help.

1032
01:38:11,525 --> 01:38:14,039
我们不用你帮忙
{\fs14}We don't need any of your help.

1033
01:38:18,965 --> 01:38:20,398
-怎么啦？
{\fs14}What?

1034
01:38:20,525 --> 01:38:24,916
- 他好像说“老韩”   - 还有机会救老韩
{\fs14}- It sounds like Han. - There's still a chance to save Han...

1035
01:38:25,845 --> 01:38:28,962
在东侧平台
{\fs14}at the east... platform.

1036
01:38:33,005 --> 01:38:35,041
我真的很遗憾
{\fs14}I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1037
01:38:35,165 --> 01:38:36,837
毕竟他只是个武技兽
{\fs14}After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1038
01:38:37,765 --> 01:38:40,325
把韩苏洛放进货舱
{\fs14}Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

1039
01:38:54,925 --> 01:38:57,075
R2！你跑哪去了？
{\fs14}R2, where have you been?

1040
01:38:57,205 --> 01:38:59,002
转过去，你这个…
{\fs14}Wait. Turn around, you woolly-

1041
01:39:00,165 --> 01:39:02,804
快点！我们要救老韩
{\fs14}Hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter.

1042
01:39:05,445 --> 01:39:07,754
至少你还是原来的你
{\fs14}Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1043
01:39:07,885 --> 01:39:10,115
你看我这模样
{\fs14}Look what's happened to me.

1044
01:39:21,605 --> 01:39:24,073
糟了，看你后面！
{\fs14}Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

1045
01:39:36,525 --> 01:39:38,755
你进步不少，小伙子
{\fs14}You have learned much, young one.

1046
01:39:38,885 --> 01:39:40,921
我要让你一一见识
{\fs14}You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1047
01:39:52,045 --> 01:39:55,003
你跟我是一路的
{\fs14}Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1048
01:39:55,845 --> 01:39:58,200
欧比王也会同意
{\fs14}Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1049
01:40:05,965 --> 01:40:07,239
小儿科
{\fs14}All too easy.

1050
01:40:12,285 --> 01:40:14,640
皇上八成高估了你
{\fs14}Perhaps you're not as strong as the emperor thought.

1051
01:40:17,685 --> 01:40:19,243
不错
{\fs14}Impressive.

1052
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:22,478
真是不错
{\fs14}Most impressive.

1053
01:40:30,045 --> 01:40:33,560
欧比王调教得好，你能控制恐惧
{\fs14}Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear.

1054
01:40:36,245 --> 01:40:39,317
现在…发出你的怒气
{\fs14}Now, release your anger.

1055
01:40:39,445 --> 01:40:41,913
这样才能打败我
{\fs14}Only your hatred can destroy me.

1056
01:42:47,525 --> 01:42:49,356
密码被改了
{\fs14}The security code has been changed.

1057
01:42:49,485 --> 01:42:52,636
R2，叫计算机越过安全系统
{\fs14}R2, you can tell the computer to override the security systems.

1058
01:42:53,565 --> 01:42:55,203
快点！
{\fs14}R2, hurry.

1059
01:42:58,365 --> 01:43:00,560
注意，我是蓝多卡瑞辛
{\fs14}Attention. This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.

1060
01:43:00,685 --> 01:43:02,562
帝国已经控制本城
{\fs14}The Empire has taken control of the city.

1061
01:43:02,685 --> 01:43:05,404
在大军抵达之间，大家请快离开
{\fs14}I advise everyone to leave before more imperial troops arrive.

1062
01:43:11,645 --> 01:43:13,203
这边
{\fs14}This way.

1063
01:43:13,325 --> 01:43:15,441
别怪我，我是个通译
{\fs14}Well, don't blame me. I'm an interpreter.

1064
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:18,318
我哪知道那是电插座？
{\fs14}I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.

1065
01:43:39,045 --> 01:43:41,843
别管加速器，修好了
{\fs14}We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Falcon. It's fixed!

1066
01:43:46,645 --> 01:43:49,318
开门啊，傻瓜！
{\fs14}Just open the door, you stupid lump!

1067
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:59,874
我就知道你行，帅！
{\fs14}I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!

1068
01:44:23,405 --> 01:44:25,999
啊，好痛 弯腰，没脑子的…
{\fs14}That hurts! Bend down, you thoughtless

1069
01:44:32,845 --> 01:44:34,164
莉亚，快走！
{\fs14}Go!

1070
01:44:40,325 --> 01:44:42,998
我以为会被害死
{\fs14}I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me.

1071
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:44,922
当然好多了
{\fs14}Of course I've looked better.

1072
01:45:36,405 --> 01:45:39,920
你是我手下败将，抵抗也没用
{\fs14}You are beaten. It is useless to resist.

1073
01:45:40,045 --> 01:45:43,401
别跟欧比王一样被杀
{\fs14}Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

1074
01:45:58,565 --> 01:46:00,123
你跑不了
{\fs14}There is no escape.

1075
01:46:00,965 --> 01:46:03,001
别逼我杀你
{\fs14}Don't make me destroy you.

1076
01:46:06,845 --> 01:46:09,484
卢克，你不知道自己多重要
{\fs14}You do not yet realize your importance.

1077
01:46:09,605 --> 01:46:12,165
你才开始接触这力量
{\fs14}You have only begun to discover your power.

1078
01:46:12,285 --> 01:46:14,037
跟我学
{\fs14}Join me...

1079
01:46:14,165 --> 01:46:16,440
我让你出师
{\fs14}and I will complete your training.

1080
01:46:16,565 --> 01:46:18,840
你我若能合作
{\fs14}With our combined strength...

1081
01:46:18,965 --> 01:46:21,763
可以结束这场战争
{\fs14}we can end this destructive conflict...

1082
01:46:21,885 --> 01:46:24,080
使银河恢复秩序
{\fs14}and bring order to the galaxy.

1083
01:46:24,205 --> 01:46:26,594
我绝不跟你合作
{\fs14}I'll never join you!

1084
01:46:26,725 --> 01:46:30,638
你若知道黑暗面的力量
{\fs14}If you only knew the power of the dark side.

1085
01:46:30,765 --> 01:46:34,804
欧比王没告诉你，你父亲的下场
{\fs14}Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.

1086
01:46:34,925 --> 01:46:36,278
他跟我说了
{\fs14}He told me enough.

1087
01:46:38,805 --> 01:46:40,557
你杀了我父亲
{\fs14}He told me you killed him.

1088
01:46:42,285 --> 01:46:44,276
不，我就是你父亲
{\fs14}I am your father.

1089
01:46:52,485 --> 01:46:54,316
没这回事
{\fs14}That's not true.

1090
01:46:55,165 --> 01:46:56,723
不可能！
{\fs14}That's impossible!

1091
01:46:56,845 --> 01:46:59,962
你想想看，你知道事实如此
{\fs14}Search your feelings. You know it to be true.

1092
01:47:08,445 --> 01:47:12,404
你能杀掉皇帝，他也知道
{\fs14}You can destroy the emperor. He has foreseen this.

1093
01:47:12,525 --> 01:47:15,278
这是你命中注定
{\fs14}It is your destiny.

1094
01:47:15,405 --> 01:47:17,043
跟我一起
{\fs14}Join me...

1095
01:47:17,165 --> 01:47:21,283
我们父子可以统治银河
{\fs14}and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.

1096
01:47:31,485 --> 01:47:33,043
跟我走
{\fs14}Come with me.

1097
01:47:33,885 --> 01:47:35,955
只有这条路
{\fs14}It is the only way.

1098
01:48:39,525 --> 01:48:40,844
班…
{\fs14}Ben.

1099
01:48:41,685 --> 01:48:43,437
班…
{\fs14}Ben, please.

1100
01:49:10,245 --> 01:49:11,758
快听见
{\fs14}Hear me.

1101
01:49:18,445 --> 01:49:20,401
- 我们得回去   - 什么？
{\fs14}- We've got to go back. - What?

1102
01:49:20,525 --> 01:49:22,755
- 我知道卢克在哪   - 战机怎么办？
{\fs14}- I know where Luke is. - What about those fighters?

1103
01:49:23,845 --> 01:49:25,995
阿秋，照办
{\fs14}Chewie, just do it.

1104
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:27,763
好…
{\fs14}All right, all right!

1105
01:49:35,645 --> 01:49:39,524
通知驱逐舰，我要上去了
{\fs14}Alert my Stardestroyer to prepare for my arrival.

1106
01:49:49,645 --> 01:49:51,601
看，上头有人
{\fs14}Look, someone's up there.

1107
01:49:52,805 --> 01:49:55,160
是卢克，阿秋，减速
{\fs14}It's Luke. Chewie, slow down.

1108
01:49:55,285 --> 01:49:58,436
到他底下，蓝多，打开顶舱门
{\fs14}We'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch.

1109
01:50:13,725 --> 01:50:15,955
慢慢来，阿秋
{\fs14}Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1110
01:50:36,845 --> 01:50:38,881
- 蓝多？   - 可以了
{\fs14}- Lando? - Okay, let's go.

1111
01:50:58,125 --> 01:50:59,478
我们走
{\fs14}All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1112
01:51:33,605 --> 01:51:35,357
我就回来
{\fs14}I'll be back.

1113
01:51:40,885 --> 01:51:42,204
帝国驱逐舰
{\fs14}Stardestroyer.

1114
01:51:47,245 --> 01:51:49,600
阿秋，准备光速飞行
{\fs14}All right, Chewie. Ready for light speed.

1115
01:51:49,725 --> 01:51:51,681
如果加速器修好
{\fs14}If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1116
01:51:51,805 --> 01:51:54,035
方位都设定好了，就看你的了
{\fs14}All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.

1117
01:51:54,165 --> 01:51:55,564
加速！
{\fs14}Punch it!

1118
01:52:05,805 --> 01:52:08,000
他们明明说修好了
{\fs14}They told me they fixed it.

1119
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:09,922
我叫他们修的！
{\fs14}I trusted them!

1120
01:52:10,045 --> 01:52:12,434
不能怪我！
{\fs14}It's not my fault!

1121
01:52:17,845 --> 01:52:20,359
他们快被牵引光束锁定了
{\fs14}They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1122
01:52:20,485 --> 01:52:23,875
加速器有没有关掉？
{\fs14}Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?

1123
01:52:24,005 --> 01:52:25,916
--
{\fs14}- Yes, my lord. - Good.

1124
01:52:26,045 --> 01:52:29,515
好，准备登船，不要伤人
{\fs14}Prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun.

1125
01:52:29,645 --> 01:52:32,523
- 是，大人   - 副官！
{\fs14}- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant. - Yes, sir.

1126
01:52:34,045 --> 01:52:37,196
吵死了，怎么不用光速？
{\fs14}Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light speed?

1127
01:52:37,325 --> 01:52:38,838
没办法？
{\fs14}We can't?

1128
01:52:38,965 --> 01:52:41,240
怎么知道加速器关掉了？
{\fs14}How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1129
01:52:44,405 --> 01:52:47,158
城里的计算机说的？
{\fs14}The city's central computer told you?

1130
01:52:47,285 --> 01:52:49,924
陌生计算机能信吗？
{\fs14}R2-D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer.

1131
01:52:50,045 --> 01:52:53,196
你小心点！
